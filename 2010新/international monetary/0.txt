”Ukraine has secured a clear election result through free and fair elections. I welcome President Yanukovych’s announcement that his first trip abroad will be to Brussels.
Ukraine is facing major economic and financial challenges. To master these challenges, the country needs effective leadership and political stability. And we need Ukraine as a reliable partner – not just on trade matters, but also on political issues.
That is why I am travelling to Kiev today, to underscore again that if Ukraine resolutely continues its path of reform, Kiev can count on active support from Germany and Europe.“
