    08.07.2010 - Press release
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has become a reality. The organization’s Statute enters into force today (8 July). To date 29 states have ratified the Statute, while 148 states and the European Union have signed it and are thus members of the organization.
Commenting on the entry into force of the IRENA Statute, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement in Berlin today:
“I’m pleased that the vision of an International Renewable Energy Agency has become a reality in such a short space of time.
However, the entry into force of the IRENA Statute does not mark the end of the organization’s development. Our task now is to enable IRENA to commence work soon. Germany will continue to work with its partners to ensure that IRENA lends the cause of renewable energy a convincing voice in the world.”
