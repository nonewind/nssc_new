Morocco is a leader among North African nations in the field of renewable energies. It has established its own solar plan and created an agency for solar energy. The intention here is a sig­nificant increase in the proportion of the country’s energy needs met by renewable energies, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels in the long term.
The Federal Government is supporting Morocco in its development of renewable energies within the framework of bilateral development cooperation. Over the coming years, it will make available more than 40 million euro of development-cooperation funds.
Following consultation with Federal Development Minister Dirk Niebel, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle during his visit to Rabat gave the Moroccan Government confirmation of a further three million euro for concrete projects to implement the Moroccan solar plan.

“We welcome the efforts of the Moroccan Government in the pro­motion of renewable energies. With this endeavour, this country is readying its economy and infrastructure for the future.The Federal Government is investing in that future, so that Morocco can become a strategic energy partner for Germany. This development benefits not only the Moroccan people but also the German companies which wish to work with Morocco in renewable energies.”
