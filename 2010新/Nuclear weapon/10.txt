    26.03.2010 - Press release
The USA and Russia today reached agreement over the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (26 March):
“This is a good day for disarmament. I welcome today’s agreement between the USA and Russia. The reduction of strategic nuclear weapons means we have reached an important milestone and this will advance the cause of nuclear disarmament as a whole.
My hope is that it will set a powerful precedent not only for the Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty at the beginning of May but also for international disarmament efforts in other areas.”
