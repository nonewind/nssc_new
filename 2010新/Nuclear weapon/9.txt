Towards a world free of nuclear weapons - Federal Foreign Office 
    01.02.2010 - Press release
In January 2008 four recognized US authorities on security policy called for efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons: George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn. In January 2009 Helmut Schmidt, Richard von Weizsäcker, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Egon Bahr endorsed and expanded this appeal.
On Wednesday (3 February) the two “quartets” will for the first time come together in Berlin. They will be guests at a luncheon hosted by Federal Minister Guido Westerwelle and will also have a meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
