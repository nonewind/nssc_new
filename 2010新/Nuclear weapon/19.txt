Talks with Li Changchun - Federal Foreign Office 
    13.04.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Dr Guido Westerwelle today (13 April) met Li Changchun, the member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China who is responsible for culture and the media.
The talks centred on bilateral, economic, cultural and international relations.
In an in-depth discussion, Federal Minister Westerwelle drew attention to the question of Internet freedom.
In addition, Federal Minister Westerwelle asked Mr Li to work to ensure Deutsche Welle can be received in China just as, for example, the Chinese television station CCTV can be received in Germany as a matter of course.
The ongoing discussions concerning the Iranian nuclear programme were also addressed. Federal Minister Westerwelle emphasized that Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. For the Minister, the idea of an Iran with nuclear weapons is however absolutely unacceptable. As he underscored, the international community cannot stand back and do nothing in the face of Iran’s continued refusal to cooperate.
