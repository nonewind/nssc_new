Upper Middle Rhine Valley to remain UNESCO World Heritage site - Federal Foreign Office 
    30.07.2010 - Press release
On Thursday (29 July) the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in session in the Brazilian capital Brasilia gave the go-ahead to begin planning a Rhine crossing in the Upper Middle Rhine Valley.
The Federal Foreign Office welcomes this decision, which will allow cultural landscapes not only to be preserved but also developed further. The Committeeâ€™s decision on a proposal put forward by Land Rhineland-Palatinate is the result of the close cooperation and full information provided by the German authorities.
On the basis of the new studies submitted, the Committee came to the conclusion that the economically best option for a Rhine crossing would be a bridge, which in principle would not compromise the unique character of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. The Committee recommended drawing up a master plan to determine how the Valley should be developed as a World Heritage Site in the medium and long term.
At its next session the Committee intends to take stock of how planning is proceeding. The German authorities are accordingly requested to submit a report on this by February 2012. The intensive dialogue in this connection is to be continued.
