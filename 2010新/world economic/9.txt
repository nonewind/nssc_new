    06.12.2010 - Press release
During a meeting of the Brazil Board of the Federation of German Industries at the Federal Foreign Office, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today emphasized his readiness to actively support German industry’s interests in Brazil:
“Brazil is a key economic partner with a considerable potential for growth in every respect. I therefore welcome the great interest shown in Brazil by German industry and its readiness to step up its activities in that country. Especially in view of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, there are huge opportunities in the sphere of infrastructure and we intend to do everything we can to enable German industry to take advantage of them.”
