    06.09.2010 - Press release

Promoting external economic affairs is one of the core tasks of the Federal Foreign Office and its 228 missions abroad. Tomorrow (7 September) a Business Forum will be held in the Federal Foreign Office as part of this year’s Ambassadors Conference.
Over 1000 delegates from more than 500 German companies will meet representatives of the Federal Foreign Office and German missions abroad in order to discuss the opportunities and prospects for German business overseas and Government support strategies.
The Forum will be opened by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, Federal Economics Minister Rainer Brüderle and Anton F. Börner, President of the Federation of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade.
The theme of this year’s conference is the development of Latin America and the Caribbean. However, participants of the Business Forum will also be able to discuss other parts of the world in regional fora. For the first time there will also be a focused exchange of experiences between businesses and ambassadors on current issues related to external economic affairs, which will take place through workshops, round-table discussions and other fora. Topics include “Values as a competitive advantage internationally”, “German craftsmanship worldwide” or “Issuing visas for business travellers”.
The Federal Foreign Office has a presence worldwide through its missions abroad. Many large, but also numerous medium-sized companies value, and are keen to take advantage of, the opportunity for direct contact and discussion with the heads of mission.
