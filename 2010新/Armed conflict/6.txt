    01.03.2010 - Press release
In connection with the renewed outbreak of armed conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (1 March) issued the following statement:
“I am gravely concerned about the new fighting in Darfur. We strongly urge all factions to end hostilities immediately.
The ceasefire agreed last week between the Sudanese Government and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement is a ray of hope for a country that has suffered so much. It is crucial that this ceasefire should be respected and pave the way for peace negotiations at the earliest possible date. We call on all other rebel factions to endorse the ceasefire as well.”
