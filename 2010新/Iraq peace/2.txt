The initiative aims to provide future-oriented further training and to encourage a lively intercultural exchange so as to bring young specialists from Iraq and from German companies together.
Minister of State Cornelia Pieper today (23 November) issued the following statement on tomorrow’s event:
“Iraq is facing huge challenges – not only in policymaking, but also with regard to economic reconstruction.Well-trained young Iraqis are indispensable if these challenges are to be tackled as efficiently as possible. “Iraq Horizons” is designed to help by opening up an additional training perspective for young Iraqis.“
”Iraq Horizons 2015: sow today, harvest tomorrow” is a joint initiative by the Federal Foreign Office, the Goethe-Institut, the German Association of Chambers of Industry and Commerce and the Federation of German Industries. It is financed by the Federal Foreign Office. “Iraq Horizons” thus feeds into the Federal Government’s broad-based efforts to help Iraq on the road to political stabilization and with reconstruction.
