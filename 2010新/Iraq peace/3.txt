Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle calls for government to be formed in Iraq without delay - Federal Foreign Office 
    12.11.2010 - Press release

Yesterday, over eight months since the parliamentary elections of 7 March 2010, the Iraqi Parliament re-elected Jalal Talabani as the country’s President. Nouri al-Maliki, the acting Prime Minister, was asked to form a new government by President Talabani.
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (12 November):

“The formation of a new government in Iraq is overdue and is indispensable for reconciliation and stability in the country. It is now crucial that it be completed quickly, in the interest of the people of Iraq, so that progress can be made on the urgently needed reforms. The new Iraqi government will face major challenges. It will have to do everything in its power to advance the social and economic reconstruction of the country and to forge ahead with the necessary reconciliation process. The political stalemate of the past months has shown how difficult this path is. But there is no alternative. It is the only route that offers the people of Iraq a real chance of lasting peace and prosperity. We and our European partners will continue to do our utmost to support the new Iraqi government on this road.”
