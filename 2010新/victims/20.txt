Federal Minister Westerwelle condemns attacks in south-eastern Iran - Federal Foreign Office 
    16.07.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (16 July) issued the following statement on yesterday’s twin attacks on a Shiite mosque in Zahedan in south-eastern Iran which have so far claimed over 20 lives and injured dozens and for which the Sunni rebel group Jundallah has claimed responsibility:
“I was horrified to hear of these dreadful terrorist attacks which have killed and injured many innocent people.
I condemn these insidious attacks in the sharpest possible terms. Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. I wish the many injured a speedy recovery.
The increasing frequency of terrorist attacks in recent months in this region too shows that terrorist violence is a danger worldwide. This underlines once again the need for us to work together to counter it.”
Federal Minister Westerwelle extended condolences to Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki on behalf of the entire Federal Government.
