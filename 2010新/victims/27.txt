Federal Minister Westerwelle condemns attacks in Iraq - Federal Foreign Office 
    23.04.2010 - Press release
After the recent attacks in Baghdad and in western Iraq, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (23 April):
“I condemn in the strongest possible terms the latest bomb attacks in Iraq, in which dozens of people lost their lives or were seriously injured. I would like to express our heartfelt sympathy to the entire Iraqi people as well as to the families of the victims, and I wish those injured a speedy recovery.
The perpetrators must not be allowed to halt the process of reconciliation and stabilization in Iraq with their callous attacks. Only through peace and democracy can Iraq achieve a brighter future. I therefore call upon all political forces in the country to continue along the path of reconciliation so that a viable government can be formed as quickly as possible.”
Attacks against state institutions and members of various religious groups in Iraq have been stepped up over the past months. The most recent attack took place on 4 April when several people lost their lives in bomb attacks on several embassies in Baghdad, including the Germany Embassy.
