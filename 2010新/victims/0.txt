    10.08.2010 - Press release
Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office Cornelia Pieper today (10 August) sent a message of condolence to Prof. Władysław Bartoszewski, the Polish State Secretary and Commissioner for International Dialogue in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.
The message reads as follows:
”I heard the sad news that three Polish lives were claimed by the recent flooding along the Neisse and offer you my deepest sympathy. People in Germany can relate particularly well to the difficult circumstances experienced by their Polish neighbours precisely because it is the German-Polish border region that is affected.
My thoughts are with the families of the victims and all those who have lost everything as a result of the flooding. In a spontaneous act of solidarity, the Workers’ Samaritan Federation despatched an aid delivery to Bogatynia last night. I wish you and the Polish authorities all the strength you need to cope with these difficult circumstances and hope that the situation will soon improve.“
