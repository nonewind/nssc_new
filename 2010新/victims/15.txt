    12.07.2010 - Press release
According to latest reports, several dozen people died yesterday in the Ugandan capital Kampala in bomb attacks on FIFA World Cup Final screenings in the city. Many more people were hurt, including a German national who suffered minor injuries. Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (12 June) in Berlin:
”I condemn these horrific attacks in the strongest possible terms. How anyone can perpetrate such an insidious crime against fans peacefully enjoying a sports event beggars belief. It shows the shameless inhumanity of those behind the bombings. Our thoughts and profound sympathies go out to the relatives of the victims and we wish the injured a speedy recovery.“
