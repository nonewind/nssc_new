    07.10.2010 - Press release
On hearing about the attack, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (7 October) in Berlin:
”I was shocked and deeply saddened at the news that a German soldier has been killed in Baghlan province. For the coming hours and days I wish his injured comrades strength and the speediest possible recovery. At this difficult time our thoughts and sympathy are with the victims’ families and loved ones.
I utterly condemn this cowardly attack. This act of barbarism is directed not merely against us Germans but also against the vast majority of Afghans, who seek a policy of peace and reconciliation for their country.“
