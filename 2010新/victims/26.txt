    18.07.2010 - Press release
Dozens of people were killed and many more injured in a suicide attack on Iraqi security forces near Baghdad this morning. Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (18 July) issued the following statement:
”I condemn this latest suicide attack in the sharpest possible terms. I extend my profound sympathies to the families and relatives of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery.
The chain of terrorist acts in recent months is a serious threat to the process of reconciliation and democratic development in Iraq.
It is all the more important, therefore, over four months after the elections, that a government capable of action is at last formed, with the involvement of all political forces in Iraq, which is able to continue the process of democratic stabilization.“
For several months now there have again been more frequent attacks on state institutions and members of various faith groups in Iraq.
Attempts to form a government in Iraq are still ongoing following the parliamentary elections of 7 March.
