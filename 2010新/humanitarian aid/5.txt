Human Rights Commissioner on the occasion of Human Rights Day - Federal Foreign Office 
    10.12.2010 - Press release
Markus Löning, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement today (10 December) to mark Human Rights Day:

“Human Rights Day is vitally important to Germany’s foreign policy: championing human rights and the rule of law around the world is one of the German Government’s central foreign policy goals.Yesterday’s vote in the US House of Representatives against closing the prison camp at Guantánamo is a step we very much regret, especially on Human Rights Day. Human rights and the right to a fair trial apply to everyone. Guaranteeing the rights of those who do not share our own views should be a matter of course in a state based on the rule of law.”
