    22.06.2010 - Press release
At the invitation of Markus Löning, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, the first Human Rights Commissioner’s Round Table took place yesterday (21 June) at the Federal Foreign Office to discuss strategies in the campaign against capital punishment. In this connection Markus Löning issued the following statement:
“Working for the worldwide abolition of capital punishment is one of our core foreign policy priorities. We see a distinct trend towards abolition, which is encouraging. But it is also clear that much still remains to be done. In many countries there is widespread opposition to abolishing capital punishment. Here especially we must seek to open a critical dialogue. But I am also keen to encourage those who have taken steps in the right direction, and to motivate those who are on the brink of abolishing capital punishment to take that courageous final step.
The Round Table was an opportunity for me and my guests from non-governmental organizations to share information and develop ideas on how we can best work together in the countries concerned to advance our goal.”
The Human Rights Commissioner’s Round Table seeks to foster intensive dialogue with representatives of civil society and non-governmental organizations on key human rights issues. Apart from information sharing, the prime aim is to develop strategies and identify operational options.
