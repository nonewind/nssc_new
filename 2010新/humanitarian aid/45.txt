    06.10.2010 - Press release
The Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, Markus Löning, today (6 October) issued the following statement on the release of Ethiopian opposition politician Birtukan Mideksa:

“I am extremely pleased to learn that Birtukan Mideksa has just been amnestied and released from prison. Her imprisonment, which lasted a total of 40 months, was watched with great concern by many people inside and outside Ethiopia. The Federal Government repeatedly raised Ms Birtukan’s case in its contacts with Ethiopian partners.
My wish now for Ms Birtukan and her little daughter is that they may recover quickly from what have been for them very difficult years.
I congratulate the Ethiopian leadership on its farsighted decision and very much hope that this marks the starting-point for an intensified, fruitful dialogue among all political forces in Ethiopia.”
