“More investment in the education of women and girls in Afghanistan” - Federal Foreign Office 
    22.03.2010 - Press release
Cornelia Pieper, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, has welcomed comments made by Monika Lüke, the Secretary-General of amnesty international Germany, stating that more should be invested in education in Afghanistan. The Minister of State issued the following statement in Berlin today:
“Germany is playing a leading role in the international efforts to strengthen education in Afghanistan. The German Government will have made available more than 110 million euro for culture and education in Afghanistan by the end of 2010. In particular, the assistance from Germany will provide women and girls with ever better access to education. The share of women in higher education and in vocational training is around 20%.
One third of the scholarships awarded by Germany to Afghan university lecturers goes to women. Nevertheless, much still remains to be done.”
At the international Afghanistan Conference held in London in late January, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called for human rights, and in particular women’s rights, to be respected. Moreover, these rights are a cross-cutting issue which is given special weight in all support measures in Afghanistan financed by Germany.
