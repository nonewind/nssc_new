Federal Minister Westerwelle on elections in Myanmar - Federal Foreign Office 
    11.11.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (11 November) issued the following statement on the recent elections in Myanmar:
 

“Even if four days after the elections in Myanmar still no official results have been announced, it is important to note there are clear indications that the ballot-counting has been strongly rigged against the democratic Opposition. The way the elections have been conducted has put the Opposition and the parties representing the ethnic minorities at a massive disadvantage. This electoral process can regrettably in no way be considered free, fair and inclusive. Reports of Opposition successes in at least some electoral districts show, however, that the desire of the people of Myanmar for democratic change cannot in the long run be suppressed. We appeal to Myanmar’s future Government to finally embrace an agenda to advance respect for human rights, genuine democratic reforms and national reconciliation. This is the only course that serves the country’s interests. In this connection we renew our call for the immediate release of all political prisoners and an end to Aung San Suu Kyi’s house arrest.”
