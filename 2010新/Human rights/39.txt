Human Rights Commissioner Löning meets OSCE CiO Representatives to promote tolerance - Federal Foreign Office 
    21.07.2010 - Press release
Markus Löning, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, today (21 July) met the OSCE CiO Representatives to promote tolerance, Rabbi Andrew Baker and Ambassador Adil Akhmetov. After the meeting he issued the following statement:
“How do we treat each other? In view of the different cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds of people in our countries, this has become one of the vital issues for our coexistence. This is proved by the many debates currently taking place, for example on banning the burka. The work of the OSCE CiO Representatives to promote tolerance is therefore all the more important both for the cohesion of our societies and for the success of the OSCE as a whole.
In my good and fruitful talks with Rabbi Baker and Ambassador Akhmetov I made it clear that the German Government wholeheartedly supports their work and will pay great attention to the country report which they will produce following this visit.”
The Personal Representatives of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office promote tolerance and combat racism, xenophobia and discrimination. Rabbi Baker is the Personal Representative on Combating Anti-Semitism, while Ambassador Akhmetov is the Personal Representative on Combating Intolerance and Discrimination against Muslims.
The two Representatives are visiting Germany to review the situation here, and to that end will speak to members of the Federal Government and of civil society.
