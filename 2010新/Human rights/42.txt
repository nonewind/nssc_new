International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination - Federal Foreign Office 
    19.03.2010 - Press release
To mark United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (Sunday, 21 March), the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Günter Nooke, today (19 March) issued the following statement:
“Racism and discrimination against persons because of their ethnic origin, skin colour, religion, culture, faith, gender or beliefs is a disregard of the fundamental rights of every individual and a violation of human dignity. Racism and discrimination cannot be tolerated by anyone committed to human rights and human dignity. For this reason the global fight against racism and discrimination remains a key concern and focus of the Federal Government’s human rights policy.”
