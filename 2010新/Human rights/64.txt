    05.05.2010 - Press release
The Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office, Markus Löning, left today (5 May) for a trip to the Republic of Moldova.
He is scheduled to have talks in Chisinau with Prime Minister Filat, Foreign Minister Leanca and Deputy Justice Minister Efrim. The Commissioner will also meet members of parliament, representatives of non-governmental organizations and international experts.
Before embarking on his trip, the Commissioner said:
”The new Government of the Republic of Moldova attaches great importance to the subject of human rights and is taking significant steps to establish an effective rule of law and to protect human rights.
During my trip I want to see for myself how things are developing, but I also regard my visit as a signal of encouragement: countries taking such steps must receive our tangible support. I am also keen to examine the effects of the European Neighbourhood Policy on the human rights situation in our partner countries.“
