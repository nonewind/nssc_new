    16.02.2010 - Press release
Within the framework of cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, the Federal Foreign Office is helping to improve the agricultural infrastructure in the Jordan Valley. The construction of greenhouses, stables and water conduits in the village of Jiftlik near Jericho, which the Federal Foreign Office is financing to the tune of 180,000 euro, is designed to benefit 80 families in this village, which mainly depends on agriculture for a living.
Today (16 February), Wolf Ruthart Born, State Secretary at the Federal Foreign Office, officially opened nine greenhouses in Jiftlik together with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
This project was made possible by cooperation with the Medico International NGO and the Palestinian Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC).
The Federal Government supports Prime Minister Fayyad’s “two year plan”, which aims to create state structures in the Palestinian territories. During his visit to the Palestinian territories on 24 November 2009, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle spoke out in favour of expanding the Federal Government’s involvement in developing and improving state and civil-society structures there. This includes sustainably upgrading infrastructure and economic development. Numerous projects have already been realized, for example the promotion of education by building schools. The Federal Foreign Office made available around 1.7 million euro in support for such projects in 2009. Specific measures are aimed at improving the long-term prospects of young people in particular.
