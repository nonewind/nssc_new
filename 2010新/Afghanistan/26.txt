    04.06.2010 - Press release
The three-day meeting of representatives of the Afghan tribes, politicians and religious leaders ended today (4 June) with a vote in favour of reconciliation with the militant opposition.
Commenting on this, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today in Berlin:
”I welcome the signal of Afghan national reconciliation sent out by the Jirga in Kabul. In the final declaration the Afghan people has impressively stated its desire for a political solution. I therefore call on all sides in Afghanistan to put an end to violence and to participate in this process. Today’s result is an important first step towards reintegration and reconciliation. Germany will do whatever it can to support the Afghan Government’s further efforts.“
Around 1600 delegates from all over the country, more than 20% of them women, took part in the “Peace Jirga”. The Federal Foreign Office supported the holding of the Jirga by refitting and equipping the traditional Afghan tent.
