The Federal Cabinet approved the Federal Government’s 14th Annual Report on Cultural Relations and Education Policy today (12 January). The Report, which was drafted under the responsibility of the Federal Foreign Office, outlines the conceptual approach to and main focus of cultural relations and education policy from July 2009 through November 2010.
Minister of State Pieper today (12 January) issued the following statement on the approval of the Report:
In the period under review, the Federal Foreign Office started two major new initiatives. “German – Language of Ideas” is designed to actively promote the German language at global level, whereas “Sports and Foreign Policy” was launched to harness the many sport promotion projects which often help build civil society structures in partner countries.

“The Report showcases the multi-faceted activities of the Federal Government in the field of cultural relations and education policy. Whether in Latin America or in Afghanistan, we are able to reach people all over the world directly through our schools, scholarships and cultural programmes, thus building bridges across national and cultural divides.
