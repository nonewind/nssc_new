    15.04.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (15 April) on the deaths of German troops in Baghlan, Afghanistan:
”I was deeply saddened at the news of the deaths of our soldiers near Baghlan. At this difficult hour our thoughts and sympathy are with the victims, their families, their fellow soldiers and friends. With all my heart I wish those injured strength and the speediest possible recovery.
I utterly condemn this cowardly attack on the fallen soldiers, on us, on all Germans. But this attack also impacts the vast majority of Afghans, who abhor this terrorism just as much as we do. In these difficult times we stand united behind the men and women in the Bundeswehr who are risking their lives in Afghanistan to defend our freedom.“
