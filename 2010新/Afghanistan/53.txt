Germany and Canada support capacity-building for Afghan Border Police - Federal Foreign Office 
    16.06.2010 - Press release
In the presence of acting Afghan Interior Minister General Munir Mangal, German Ambassador Werner Lauk and Canadian chargé d’affaires Cindy Termorshuizen, a new training centre for the Afghan Border Police was inaugurated today (16 June) in Kabul.
Police training is an important focus of Germany’s engagement in Afghanistan. A well-trained Border Police force can play a key role in enhancing security on the country’s borders and at its airports. The new academy will thus make a major contribution to enabling Afghanistan to take responsibility for its own security.
The new Border Police faculty’s training capacities can cater for 400 police cadets (male and female) as well as 50 police instructors. The Afghan Border Police is responsible for providing security at airports and on the country’s borders.
The six million euro construction costs for the new police academy were shared 50:50 between Germany and Canada. This project is yet another example of the two countries’ successful cooperation in Afghanistan.
