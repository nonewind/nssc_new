Federal Government increases humanitarian assistance to a total of 10 million euro for the survivors of the floods in Pakistan - Federal Foreign Office 
    11.08.2010 - Press release
In response to the United Nations “Pakistan Initial Floods Emergency Response Plan” announced today in New York, the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development have each increased their earlier pledge of aid in the immediate aftermath of the floods to 5 million euro, bringing the total to 10 million euro.
The United Nations appeal is evidence of both the scale of the damage and the huge number of people affected by the catastrophe. In all, nearly 14 million people across the country are directly affected by the devastating impact of the floods. The most urgent requirements are for food, drinking water and tents, as well as medical care. The financial humanitarian assistance provided by the Federal Government goes to UN organizations and German non-governmental organizations that are helping to meet these needs and thus directly improve the situation for those affected.
