Using the signal from Washington to work for concrete progress on disarmament - Federal Foreign Office 
    14.04.2010 - Press release
At the end of the Washington Nuclear Security Summit, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (14 April) in Berlin:
“The Washington summit sends a powerful and responsible signal that the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear material and technology must be stopped.
Work on concrete progress towards disarmament and non-proliferation must now continue, because these are two sides of the same coin.
We have an ambitious programme of work ahead – at the Meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers next week in Tallinn we will also discuss the issues of nuclear strategy and disarmament. The question at hand is what NATO as an alliance can do to help achieve disarmament progress without jeopardizing our security.
At the beginning of May the important Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference takes place. We will do all we can to ensure that this Conference is a success and that it helps strengthen the global non-proliferation regime.”
