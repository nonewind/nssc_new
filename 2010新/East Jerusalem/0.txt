Westerwelle: Announcement of further homes in East Jerusalem sends the wrong message at the wrong time - Federal Foreign Office 
    10.03.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (10 March) on yesterday’s announcement that 1600 new homes are to be built in East Jerusalem:
“I am deeply concerned about the Israeli Government’s decision. The announcement that new homes are to be constructed sends the wrong signal at the wrong time.
Our stance on the settlement question is as clear as that of the EU and the entire international community. It is set forth in the road map and provides for a freeze on settlement activities.
We hope that the planned indirect peace talks between the parties will commence as soon as possible and support all steps in this direction.”
