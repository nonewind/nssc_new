    09.12.2010 - Press release
On the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid Markus Löning issued the following statement today (9 December):

“I congratulate Liu Xiaobo most warmly on the Nobel Peace Prize. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo pays well-deserved tribute to his courage and his tireless work for freedom and human rights. The participation of Germany as well as all EU partners represented in Oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in Oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect –for Liu Xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence. I call upon the Chinese Government to release Liu Xiaobo and all other political prisoners. Liu Xiaobo is not a one-off case. All around the world people are persecuted for their courageous stance for human rights. Supporting them is a central tenet of German foreign policy.”
