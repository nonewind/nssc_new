Federal Foreign Office provides emergency aid for flood victims in Benin - Federal Foreign Office 
    03.11.2010 - Press release
After days of heavy rainfall in western parts of Central Africa, large swathes of Benin, including the capital, Cotonou, are under water. Up to 700,000 people, many of them children, have been affected by the flooding. Approximately 200,000 people have been left homeless.
The Federal Foreign Office is providing up to EUR 400,000 for immediate emergency assistance measures. The Government of Benin had previously asked the German Government for support, particularly to combat the spread of epidemics.
These funds will go towards emergency medical care, cholera prevention and the distribution of relief supplies such as mosquito nets in the affected regions. These measures are being implemented by the aid organization Humedica e.V., which is already active in Benin, as well as other German non-governmental organizations.
The flooding and heavy rains also extend to neighbouring countries such as Nigeria, Togo, Ghana and the Niger. The Federal Foreign Office is closely following developments in these countries too.
