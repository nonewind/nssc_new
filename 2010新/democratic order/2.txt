After the recent violent clashes, during which several people were killed, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement in Berlin today (20 April):
“I’ve been following the worsening security situation in Kyrgyzstan with concern. Everything possible must be done to prevent further violence, looting and bloodshed.
After the unrest of the last few weeks, the country now urgently needs calm and stability in an orderly democratic framework based on the rule of law. We will consult with our partners in the EU and the OSCE on how we can assist Kyrgyzstan in this.”
The Minister is receiving regular briefings on developments in Kyrgyzstan. The German Embassy in Bishkek is the only EU member state embassy in the country.
