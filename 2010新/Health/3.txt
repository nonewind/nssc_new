    04.08.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (4 August) met Malaysian Foreign Minister Dato´Sri Anifah Bin Haji Aman for an exchange of views.
The talks focused on issues on the current international agenda. On the subject of Afghanistan, the two ministers agreed on the importance of rigorously translating the goals set at the Kabul Conference on Afghanistan on 20 July into practical policy over the months ahead. As a joint contribution to Afghanistan’s development, they committed to cooperate in improving health care in the country.
Turning to Iran, both ministers called for progress in the talks on the country’s nuclear programme. They agreed that Iran had the right to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. It was essential, however, that the country cooperated fully and in a transparent manner with the IAEA in Vienna.
The Malaysian Foreign Minister finally elucidated the common position of the ASEAN countries on the situation in Myanmar. Like Germany, the ASEAN countries call for free and fair elections and the release of all political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
