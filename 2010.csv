Human rights,    28.01.2011 - Interview,Standing Up to Lukashenko-by William Hague and Guido Westerwelle - Federal Foreign Office ,Interview,"Joint contribution by the British Foreign Minister William Hague and Federal Foreign MInister Guido Westerwelle published in the Wall Street Journal, 28.01.2001./////The world has looked on with growing horror as, over the last six weeks, the regime in Belarus has ruthlessly and systematically sought to dismantle the country's civil society and emerging opposition./////The violence on the night of the Dec. 19 presidential election was shocking. But while the attention of the world's media has since turned to focus on other events, the repression in Belarus has continued./////Four presidential candidates and numerous political and civil society activists remain in detention; we have no independent verification of their well-being. Many of them face years in prison on charges of organizing riots, when there is mounting evidence that the election-night violence was staged by the authorities themselves. We have seen curiously stilted recantations delivered by detained opposition activists and broadcast by the state media. We can only speculate as to what prompted them to change their tune overnight./////The regime is also pursuing other means of prosecuting those Belarusians who have dared to raise an independent voice. Every day homes and offices across Belarus are being raided and trashed. More than 200 people have been taken in for interrogation by the Belarusian secret service; this is in addition to the 700 who were arrested on the night of Dec. 19. We hear reports of lawyers being disbarred from practice for speaking up about the abuses to which their clients have been subjected. We are about to see mass expulsions from universities of those students who joined the protests, as happened following the last presidential election in 2006./////There is a serious crisis in the European neighborhood. We must act. At the upcoming European Union Foreign Affairs Council we will call for the EU to reinstate a harsh package of sanctions against Belarus and to consider further measures against Alexander Lukashenko's regime. We cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening today in a fellow European country. President Lukashenko has made his choice and we have no choice but to respond accordingly./////If Belarus turns its back on the world, it will be bad for Belarus. It will damage investor confidence and put it at loggerheads with the path of freedom and justice that the rest of the world prizes./////How did we reach this state of affairs?/////Just over a month ago there was a feeling that Belarus was moving ever so slowly in the right direction. Several candidates had been allowed to stand in the presidential election; they had even been given limited media exposure. Political prisoners had been freed. Tentative overtures had been made to the EU for closer economic ties./////We in the EU were ready to respond, cautiously, with greater engagement in return for continued progress toward international norms. In November, we renewed EU sanctions on Belarus but chose to hold them in suspension pending the conduct of December's election. Then came the night of Dec. 19 and its aftermath, shattering the illusion of tolerance and revealing President Lukashenko's true colors./////We are determined to take action against the Belarusian regime. At the same time, we will not abandon the people of Belarus to their fate. We will continue to support Belarusian civil society, indeed we will step up our efforts. We want the Belarusian people to understand that their fellow Europeans stand with them. And when Belarus chooses to rejoin the wider European community of nations, we will be here waiting, ready and willing to welcome her./////",0.1
Human rights,    28.05.2010 - Press release,Federal Foreign Office promoting the protection of human rights in Iraq - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"The Federal Foreign Office is granting some 61,000 euro of support for the production of ten video podcasts in Arabic focusing on human rights in Iraq. As part of the ""Human Rights Matter"" project organized by the German Institute for Human Rights together with the Goethe-Institut (dialogue point Erbil), ten young Iraqi video jockeys and film makers are in the coming weeks to produce 10-minute video podcasts on various human rights topics, such as minorities or penal matters. The podcasts will then be presented in Iraq and potentially also in other Arab countries via websites, film presentations and seminars./////Given the ongoing difficult human rights situation in Iraq, the project aims to find new ways of anchoring human rights questions more strongly in Iraqi minds. The aim is to make a lasting contribution to strengthening Iraqi civil society./////The project fits into the German Government's many efforts to help bring political and social stability to Iraq. Since 2003, the German Government has donated aid to the tune of 400 million euro. This money is being used to fund numerous projects in the fields of institution-building, further training and human rights.//////////",0.2
Human rights,    06.10.2010 - Speech,Address by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the presentation of the German Africa Award by the German Africa Foundation - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __//////////Dr Chambas,Professor Hornhues,Dr Eid,Dr Kohler,Professor Driftmann,Ms Schaeffer,Ms Diallo,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,//////////Fifty years ago the world gazed spellbound toward Africa. In 1960, the Year of Africa, no less than 17 countries gained independence. 2010 has in its own way also become a Year of Africa./////South Africa seized the FIFA World Cup as an opportunity for the continent as a whole. This global event single-handedly swept away decades' worth of stereotypes./////Germany had a very similar experience four years earlier./////Everyone in this room knows that Africa is much more than poverty, crisis and disaster. Beyond the walls of this room, however, the fact that many economies in Africa are growing just as fast as in Asia is often still overlooked, as is the fact that an increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location, that a new middle class is gradually emerging there. There is good reason why countries such as China are now more present than ever in Africa./////Despite all the challenges, what I see above all when I look at Africa today are major opportunities and untapped potential-economic and political./////African political leaders are taking the continent's fate ever more into their own hands. Regional cooperation is on the rise. The clout of African regional organizations is growing. The principle of ownership is impacting behaviour./////We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper./////We cannot solve the world's most pressing problems without our neighbouring continent Africa./////We need a common response to climate change and its consequences, to development and food security issues, and to the challenges posed by rapidly growing or aging populations./////The time has come for a new turn towards partnership in our Africa policy. Away from a donor-recipient outlook. Towards a global responsibility partnership on equal footing./////The German Government will soon present a comprehensive concept for Africa, which takes into account Africa's changed self-perception as well as our own interests./////We see many young faces in the crowd gathered here today. These are the faces of the graduates of the Federal Foreign Office's first Training for International Diplomats course for French-speaking diplomats from Africa. We bid all of you a heartfelt welcome!/////It is up to your generation to create the new image of Africa and to shape future ties between Germany and Africa. Work with us for peace and development, live out our shared values. We can make freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights into a reality-in Africa, in Europe, and around the world./////Protecting human rights is an inextricable part of the connection between Europe and Africa. Human rights are the indispensable basis on which Europe and Africa can jointly help shape globalization./////Political rights are equal in importance to social and economic rights. For many years Germany has been calling for the United Nations to recognize the right to water as a human right. It is a great success that the General Assembly joined us in this position in July, and the Human Rights Council last week./////Germany has constantly worked to gain a greater say at the United Nations for the countries of the southern hemisphere./////The world is changing-the geopolitical balance is shifting eastward and southward. Africa is a part of these changes./////This holds especially true of peace and security. A Security Council without a strong African presence no longer reflects the current political reality./////We want to reform the Security Council to ensure that Africa is represented among the permanent members./////Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany. There can be no development without peace and security, as evidenced by the conflicts in Côte d'Ivoire, in the Sudan, in Somalia, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo./////That's why Germany promotes the multilateral approaches of the United Nations, the European Union and the G8, which aim for a viable African security architecture./////African security structures must grow stronger so that African solutions to African problems can be found. This is what the African Union expects of itself, an expectation which we strongly support./////The Economic Community of West African States has likewise raised its political profile beyond its original economic orientation. Progress in peace and security is all the more precious at a time when resources are scarce in the countries of West Africa. The trend in the region in recent years has been positive. The tireless work of ECOWAS has borne fruit./////I am extraordinarily pleased that Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas has received this year's German Africa Award./////Dr Chambas, your farsightedness, your courage, your political instincts and your tireless work on behalf of peace and freedom, development and reconciliation have achieved great things in West Africa./////Long before you joined ECOWAS, your reputation as a prudent mediator and conciliator preceded you./////Peaceful settlements in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in Côte d'Ivoire, in Guinea-Bissau and in Togo all bear your mark./////Under your leadership ECOWAS has also worked on solutions to the recent conflicts in Guinea and Niger. We shall miss you very much after your departure from ECOWAS. But I am confident that in other areas you will continue to act with every bit as much determination for the realization of your vision of democracy and the rule of law in West Africa./////It is above all thanks to you that democracy and the rule of law, good governance and human rights are now shared values of all ECOWAS member states./////Security and economic development can succeed only through regional cooperation. This principle has proved its worth in Europe and it is proving its worth in Africa too./////I thank you for your tireless work and unwavering commitment.//////////",0.1
Human rights,    24.03.2010 - Press release,Closer German-Russian cooperation - Federal Foreign Office ,forum,"Andreas Schockenhoff, Member of the German Bundestag, was today confirmed as Coordinator of German-Russian Intersocietal Cooperation by the Federal Cabinet. To mark the occasion, Schockenhoff issued the following statement today (24 March) in Berlin://///""Intersocietal cooperation with Russia is becoming an increasingly important part of overall German-Russian relations. By appointing a ""Russia Coordinator"" the German Government is underlining the significance of people-to-people contacts./////I look forward to continuing and developing this task. My concern is to foster partnerships between towns, cities and districts, exchange and youth programmes, and contacts between NGOs and other private initiatives. These links are the engine on a future-looking close relationship between Germans and Russians./////The modernization agenda with which President Medvedev wants to create a more open Russia brings new tasks for intersocietal cooperation with that country. For this reason I last year formulated 10 theses on German-Russian intersocietal cooperation, which I will refine and implement together with representatives of German and Russian civil society. The aim is modern, project-oriented cooperation./////To that end I will, together with the major German NGOs, set up a ""Civil Society Forum Russia"" in an effort to strengthen the work of the exchange organizations engaged in Russia. On the Russian side, I will continue the collaboration begun in 2009 with the Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights Council and its Chair, Ms Ella Pamfilova. On 17 June 2010 Ms Pamfilova and I will hold a conference in Berlin, and in mid-October there will be a second conference with Russian participants in Moscow./////To enable broader school and youth exchange, I will work towards liberalizing visa requirements. I call on the Russian side to play its part by giving German-Russian youth exchange the necessary political and financial backing./////Intersocietal cooperation with Russia must also be enhanced at EU level. I will therefore, on 6 May, hold an expert round-table discussion on ""EU-Russia-New Prospects for Intersocietal Cooperation"", in which EU Commission, Russian, Polish and French experts will take part./////To mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II, on 9 May, I will lay a wreath in a Soviet prisoner of war cemetery in Luckenwalde. This autumn, in St Petersburg, I will take part in a seminar with the ""Memorial"" human rights group on ""remembrance culture"" issues in Western and Eastern Europe""./////",0.1
Human rights,    08.07.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Minister Guido Westerwelle in the German Bundestag on freedom of religion - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,/////An active human rights policy is the trademark of Germany's foreign policy. Promoting freedom of religion is part and parcel of this active human rights policy. I have asked for the floor because I want emphatically to underline that the commitment of the motion's sponsors and, I believe, everyone in this Chamber to freedom of religion and pluralism as well as their rejection of persecution and oppression on religious grounds is something that is not only of great importance to Parliament but is also quite explicitly a core concern of the Federal Government./////We cannot stay silent when millions of Christians worldwide cannot live their faith freely. It is good that this is a matter of concern to us all, irrespective of party affiliation. In many countries the Bible may neither be bought nor read; church services are obstructed; Christians are thrown into jail or sent to labour camps. They may even risk attacks on life and limb. Many countries use prohibitions, the police and punishments to prevent people from practising their faith freely. Often enough they even give their citizens free rein to attack those of other faiths. Either way, freedom of religion is suppressed: through repressive measures and persecution by the state, but also by allowing people to be hounded by the mob and forces hostile to religious tolerance./////It is important to realize-and here we can rely only on estimates by non-governmental organizations-that at least 100 million Christians around the world are currently suffering persecution. But what is at stake here is not just a commitment to the Christian religion, Christian faiths. What is at stake here is something very fundamental. It is our conviction that everyone must be able to practise the faith they themselves perceive as the true faith. Freedom of religion is always also the freedom to practise one's faith freely or to change one's faith. It also involves the right to have no religious belief at all. This is the pluralistic understanding of religious freedom, an understanding we all share not just because it is enshrined in our Basic Law but also because it informs day-to-day political life here in Germany./////Freedom of religion is therefore a right to be enjoyed by members of Christian minorities as well as by adherents of other faiths. When we call for religious freedom for Christians around the world, we must, in the interests of our own credibility, of course first ensure that the state in Germany protects the freedom of everyone in this country to practise their faith whatever their religion. I strongly endorse what Volker Kauder, the CDU/CSU parliamentary group chairperson, has said here in this connection: for us it goes without saying-not just because our constitution obliges us to do so, but because we believe passionately-that just as we insist on religious freedom in other countries, so we should do everything to ensure that freedom of religion is fully respected here in Germany and employ the whole range of instruments of state authority and those of our civil society to that end. This is more than a question of buildings. In reality it is also a question of the climate in our society. Creating the right climate-this, too, is something to which we are all committed./////If Christians just worry about the freedom of Christians, Hindus about the freedom of Hindus, and Muslims about that of Muslims, that is not what we mean by religious coexistence. Different religions can coexist successfully only through mutual respect and dialogue. But let us not deceive ourselves. Here, too, it took centuries-and I am not talking of the Middle Ages-for Europe to develop a set of values that revolve around the individual, values that include the right to practise one's faith freely./////We as Germans should also remember that even in the last century the freedom to practise one's faith in Germany was anything but a matter of course. Millions were murdered on German soil for reasons to do also with their faith. That is why when we call for other countries to respect freedom of religion, we are not preaching to them. When we stand up for religious pluralism everywhere, we are simply taking to heart the lessons of our own history./////Human dignity, freedom, personal responsibility: that is our foundation, one of the great achievements of the European Enlightenment. We stand for a state that respects these values and seek to advance this concept of the state all over the world./////It is crucial, however, that we oppose any attempt to make respect for human rights contingent on cultural factors. One hears so often that we have to be understanding about this or that, it is the product of cultural background, so to speak, or special cultural attributes. That is a kind of watering down of values that we cannot accept. Suppressing religion has nothing to do with culture, it is a negation of culture./////That is the conviction that also informs our policies, it is the conviction which we are all also committed to uphold./////It is often asserted that there is a contradiction between freedom of religion and freedom of expression. We consider it very important to point out time and time again that freedom of expression and freedom of religion are, as it were, both fruits from the same tree, that magnificent great tree of freedom. For that is the whole point. Even if, as a person who thinks, lives and has been brought up religiously, one has the feeling that one's own faith is being disparaged in some way, perhaps by cartoons or other expressions of opinion, that in no way justifies using violence against anyone. Freedom of religion and freedom of expression are by no means incompatible. The truth is that they are a wonderful pair, ladies and gentlemen!/////I would like to close by making a clear commitment on the part of the Federal Government. Anyone who incites inter-religious hatred does so above all for political, not religious reasons. Religion must never serve as a pretext for hatred, as a justification for violence and war. That is why, on behalf of the whole Chamber, I believe, the Federal Government will speak up for this in the international arena, too, by making clear that our commitment to religious freedom is a cornerstone of our human rights policy. The main theme of my speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva soon after I took office was freedom of religion, explicitly also the freedom of Christians to practise their faith and profess their beliefs, because I have the impression we must not allow this to be ignored./////With Professor Bielefeldt's appointment a few weeks ago, a German national is now the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief. For the task ahead we wish him a sure touch and all success. The goals he is working for are very important to the Federal Government and, I am sure, also to everyone in this Chamber./////If the public sees that we agree on these matters of fundamental values, that is, I believe, a good sign. As a parliamentarian I would like to say finally, with your permission, that this is something that can also be documented in the form of motions we all support./////Thank you very much./////",0.2
Human rights,    30.11.2010 - Speech,"Address by Foreign Minister Westerwelle at the third EU-Africa Summit on 30 November 2010 in Tripoli, Libya - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advanced text __//////////President of the European Council van Rompuy,Colonel Qadhafi,Deputy Chairwoman of the AU,Chairman of the AU Commission Jean Ping,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,//////////I don't want to downplay the major challenges that Africa faces. But what I see above all in Africa are major opportunities. We Europeans want to be equal partners, we want to meet on equal political and economic footing./////The question of how the EU and Africa can provide for more security and peace together is essential to our joint discussion of investment, economic growth and jobs. Prosperity is generated only in security, and lasting security only in a country under the rule of law which protects human rights./////We are all united by the goal of a security structure in Africa which can find African solutions to African problems. Peace and prosperity in Africa are also in the interest of Europe./////I would like to address here three of the many challenges the continent confronts: the Sudan, Somalia and piracy./////A peaceful referendum in the Sudan with fair results would bring increased stability to the whole region. We stand by the Sudan at this defining moment and we shall continue to do so after the referendum. Should the referendum bring about a South Sudanese state, the governments in both the north and the south will need a great deal of support in building up effective structures. Germany is ready to help./////In Somalia we have combined humanitarian aid with assistance in political reconstruction. Both bilaterally and in the EU, Germany supports the transitional government and the African Union Mission in Somalia. Of course, we cannot redress the consequences of a collapsed state on our own through EU missions to train Somali security forces or through our support for the rebuilding of the justice system. Peace can only succeed if the conflicting parties within Somalia make a serious effort to reach a peaceful solution. Because only a fair and stable social order can prevent instability and violence, we will use our networked approach to support Somalia on its path towards internal reconciliation./////The protection of humanitarian aid for Somalia is also our foremost aim in combating piracy off the coast of Somalia. Piracy threatens the women, men and children not only of Somalia, but of all of eastern Africa. It is in the shared interest of Africa and the EU for trade to remain possible in the region. Warships can only be a small part of a comprehensive solution. What the people of Somalia need first and foremost are prospects for the future./////The example of piracy shows the increase in global challenges in which Africa's interests run parallel to those of the EU. Such challenges-from piracy to fair development, from protecting human rights to combating climate change-require patience. But we must not waste any time. Ignoring problems does not make them go away./////We as the EU can achieve a great deal by working together with the AU and other regional organizations. Worldwide problems must be tackled within the United Nations. We will always be there to listen to your concerns and to support your goals in every way possible./////The Security Council cannot neglect the changes that have occurred in the past 65 years. The growing influence of Africa must be reflected in the composition of the Security Council./////Germany has supported the African Union in many ways in the past. The building of the headquarters for the AU Department of Peace and Security is only one example here. We will continue to support you.//////////",0.1
Human rights,    22.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the opening ceremony of the Nuremberg Trials Memorial - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advanced text __/////Minister Lavrov,Mr Dumas,Prosecutor-General Grieve,Ambassador Rapp,Mr Ferencz,Mayor Maly,Minister of State Neumann,Minister of Justice Merk,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,/////The Second World War ended more than 65 years ago. Now is the time to ask questions of those who experienced this era first-hand. Whatever we neglect to ask today will remain forever unasked-and unanswered./////That's why I am so especially pleased that Benjamin Ferencz will be speaking to us here today. Mr Ferencz, thank you for this./////The Nuremberg Trials were a response to the perversion of the law in National Socialist Germany. By passing the Enabling Act, the Nazis abolished democracy./////Discrimination against Jewish civil servants was called the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service./////When it enacted the Nuremberg race laws, Nazi Germany broke with the fundamental principle that all people are equal before the law. Jewish assets were stolen by the financial authorities on the basis of laws and ordinances./////The regime concealed terror and tyranny behind the mask of law and justice, and the consequence was endless suffering and the murder of millions./////In those days many wondered if those who had so blatantly trampled justice underfoot were themselves entitled to just treatment./////It is a great historic achievement that the Allies resisted the temptation to exact revenge. Revenge would have been the easiest path. But the Allies decided on the more difficult path. They charted new territory for law and for civilization by attempting to make inconceivable crimes the object of a trial. They sought and found answers to difficult political, moral and legal questions./////Who was to sit on the judges' bench, only Allied judges or Germans too?/////What law was to be applied? The trials raised questions about the criminal liability of individuals who had acted as organs of the state and the extent of the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation./////Because much was ventured here in Nuremberg-in political, legal and human terms-international law was able to progress and standards for future cases were established./////The Nuremberg Trials had no precedent, no guiding example to turn to. The Trials themselves blazed the trail for the development of international criminal law, a process which is still far from complete./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Excellencies,/////Article 1 of the German Basic Law proclaims, and I quote, ""Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority./////The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.""/////With these words the authors of the Basic Law drew a lesson for the Federal Republic from the darkest chapter of German history. The individual person is central to our constitutional order. The state must serve the individual and not the other way around. This holds true for Germany, for Europe and as a universal principle. Only the worldwide protection of human rights can prevent our world from coming undone./////It is also our history that has given rise to the German Government's obligation to advocate for human rights both in Germany and around the world./////No verdict can undo the suffering of the victims. No courtroom sentence can bring the dead back to life./////But bringing the perpetrators to trial is nonetheless important, and not only for the direct victims of the crime. The impact of a judgement based on the rule of law reaches far beyond the trial itself./////The founding of the United Nations was the ambitious attempt to counter our tumultuous world with legal structures. We all know how incomplete this task remains, but the United Nations can only be as strong as its member states allow. Germany remains committed to the goal of strengthening the rule of law in international relations. The strength of international law is the measure of our actions in the United Nations, and also in the United Nations Security Council. This is a laborious process, and we move forward only in small steps, but there is no reason to let ourselves grow discouraged./////Sixty years after the Nuremberg Trials, international criminal justice is a permanent part of international law. 114 countries have accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. We will persevere in our efforts to increase this number. We will also work for the decisions of the International Criminal Court to be applied. Germany's past has taught us how thin the veneer of our civilization is. Learning this lesson was and is our responsibility. It is no small victory that the International Criminal Court in The Hague now sends the message that political leaders must answer for their deeds-and especially for their wrongdoings./////Citizens of Europe can turn directly to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg if the country in which they live impinges upon their rights. Similar legal protection beyond the borders of Europe is an ambitious but worthy goal, and is worth fighting for. Overcoming the law of the jungle, the rule of the strong, is one of the greatest achievements of our civilization. We must accomplish the same internationally./////We want to overcome the rule of the strong by strengthening the rule of law. Step by step, and in international politics too./////The confrontation with one's own past is never complete, uncomfortable as this may be for some. The tremendous extent to which the past seeps into the present is demonstrated by the attention that the newest publication on the history of the Federal Foreign Office has recently garnered./////It is important for us to keep sight of the past. Whoever does not know the past cannot take from it any lessons for the future. It is not the duty of the young to enquire about the past, it is the duty of the older generation to take the initiative to speak about it./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The city of Nuremberg has done a great deal to further a culture of remembrance. Mayor Maly, I'm quite pleased that the Nuremberg city council has applied for this room to be added to the World Heritage list./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Excellencies,/////It was only yesterday that the Foreign Ministers of Russia, France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany sat together at a table at the NATO summit in Lisbon. This is not something to be taken for granted./////We come together not as victor and vanquished, and also not as East and West. We are partners, and for that we are eternally grateful to those among you who represent these countries, as it was by no means self-evident that you would respectfully accept Germany back into the peaceful international community after what it had done to the world in the first half of the twentieth century./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////From Vancouver to Vladivostok, we are united today by the shared pursuit of security./////Our goal is a strategic partnership that serves the interests of all./////We are experiencing Europe in an era of which generations before us dreamed in vain. We live in a Europe of peace and prosperity. Safeguarding these conditions is our shared responsibility./////Europe too is a lesson from our history. The European model of cooperation is hard work. With its all-night negotiating sessions, it takes a great deal of energy. But redressing the consequences of confrontation would be much more difficult and much more dramatic. Let us appreciate the Europe we have. I say this here in this place as a lesson of history, and I say it expressly in light of certain current discussions. Those who only ask how much something costs sometimes lose sight of how much it's worth./////Freedom, law and justice don't come about of their own accord. They must be struggled for./////We cherish the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. We owe it to them to prevent war and genocide, both within and beyond Europe./////The Nuremberg Trials were a start. The Rome Statute was a good continuation. And the establishment of the International Criminal Court in The Hague was not the end. Our shared responsibility remains: to stand up for peace, for freedom and for human rights.//////////",0.1
Human rights,    14.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on 14 November 2010 in Berlin at the main Day of National Mourning ceremony - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __///////////////Federal President,Mrs Wulff,President of the Bundesrat,President of the Bundestag,President of the Federal Constitutional Court,President of the German War Graves Commission,Colleagues,Nuncio,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,//////////Today, the Day of National Mourning, we remember all those who lost their lives through war, terror, violence and tyranny./////Today we remember those who were persecuted, mistreated and murdered because of their beliefs, religion, race, sexual orientation or simply because they were who they were./////We know how tenaciously war and violence continue to blight lives. Wars cast long shadows. Also on generations who did not experience them at first hand./////War, violence, persecution-these are not just scourges of the twentieth century. This still young twenty-first century has already seen a multitude of conflicts that have brought suffering and death to millions. Our world is not a peaceful place./////Every day we see reports and images of human tragedies that have claimed lives. We know how powerful these images are-and we know what they convey is also powerlessness. Let us never forget that every victim has a personal story. Every victim is sorely missed./////The German War Graves Commission looks after the sites where so many have found their last resting place. Through this work it gives the dead back their dignity, and the living a place to mourn and meet others who have suffered similar loss./////The German War Graves Commission carries out its valuable work at the behest of the German Government. So let me express heartfelt thanks, Mr Fhrer, to you and all the Commission's staff as well as to the whole organization./////The Commission is assisted in its activities by thousands of ordinary citizens who give generously of their time and energy. Over one million supporters and donors help ensure the organization can fulfil its important mission. This broad support in all sections of society testifies to the great respect people feel for the Commission's work. And it also highlights the importance they attach to ensuring the dead are remembered in a fitting way./////With the Iron Curtain gone, the War Graves Commission could also extend its activities to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In recent years this has led to the creation of several new German war cemeteries in Russia, most recently in Kursk and Smolensk, as well as in Belarus and Ukraine. Even 65 years after the end of World War II, however, the Commission's work is still far from over./////Just a few weeks ago another German war cemetery was consecrated in Cheb, the culmination of years of hard work. Around 5000 war dead have been laid to rest there./////The discovery of a mass grave in Slovenia containing the mortal remains of thousands killed at the end of World War II was confirmed only this week./////Through establishing and looking after over 800 war cemeteries containing almost 2 million war dead in 45 different countries, the German War Graves Commission has created not only sites of remembrance but also places where people can learn about the past. With its motto ""Reconciliation above the graves-work for peace"", the Commission aptly sums up its agenda and underlines the political significance of its work./////Federal President Theodor Heuss delivered the first speech marking the Day of National Mourning in the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany. In this speech he cited a soldier with whom he had previously discussed his thoughts on the subject. ""Don't forget,"" the soldier told him, ""that the feelings of the German mothers and wives are the feelings of the British, French, Italian, American and Russian mothers and wives as well."" The suffering of millions of families both on the side of the defeated and liberated and on the side of the victors and liberators became a common bond dedicated to reconciliation and peace that still remains strong today./////Where enmity and mistrust had long shaped perceptions on both sides, new trust could start to grow./////Trust is a most precious thing. Both between countries and between people. Trust needs time to grow and is quickly destroyed. Trust needs a solid basis. Credibility and reliability can provide that solid basis. However, trust goes beyond what there are good reasons for-it ventures into new and unknown realms. Therein lies its strength./////Sixty-five years ago no one trusted the Germans. Germany had excluded itself from the community of nations. It was in this context that the fathers and mothers of our Basic Law clearly defined in its preamble the fundamental goal of Germany policy: ""to promote world peace in a united Europe"". With this compass as our guide, over the decades we gradually built the trust without which the achievement of German unity 20 years ago would never have happened. Our country continues to steer by this compass to this day./////Germany was elected to the United Nations Security Council just a few days after we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Day of German Unity. Both events had something to do with the trust the world now has in Germany./////The great achievement of the post-war generations was to seek reconciliation with our neighbours. Here also the work of the German War Graves Commission played its part./////Today in our relations with Poland we are well on the way to forging the same kind of close ties that Germans and French people developed over the decades. Europe is growing together and we want to complete this process also with our neighbours to the East. Achieving full reconciliation with Poland we see as our historic mission./////The European Union is the starting-point for Germany's whole foreign policy. Europe means greater freedom, greater security and greater prosperity for everyone. But even more important, European integration has, right from the start, been a unique project for peace. The old paradigm of confrontation in Europe has given way to a new paradigm of cooperation and integration./////While we may complain about Europe at times, we must never forget what we owe to Europe. If Europe had given us no more than decades of peace on our continent, it would still have been worth it./////I am rather concerned right now about Europe. I can only warn against any trend towards renationalization directed against Europe. Those who responded to the euro crisis this spring by calling the whole European idea into question have learned nothing from history. Cooperation can be tough going. But anyone familiar with the consequences of confrontation, anyone familiar with European history knows that cooperation is worth every ounce of effort./////The secret of the success of European integration is the table in Brussels, around which all EU countries sit as equal partners with the same rights, whatever their size. The Union is not divided into important and unimportant countries. We have only been able to overcome centuries of confrontation by cooperating and treating each other as equals./////As individuals, we all owe each other respect. As countries, too, we all owe each other respect./////That goes for Europe and for the whole world as well./////In many parts of the world today peace, freedom and human rights are under threat. Germany is living up to its international responsibilities. This is incumbent on us also in the light of our history. In the so-called Third Reich what was lost first was respect for the human rights of some and then the freedom of everyone in Germany and finally peace in Europe and the whole world./////Today, however, Germany's commitment to peace, freedom and human rights is universally recognized. We are participating in several peace missions. All with a clearcut mandate from the United Nations. We see the use of military force only as a last resort. Where military force is concerned, Germany remains committed to a culture of restraint./////As is clear from our engagement in Afghanistan, working for peace and human rights can be a dangerous business. Forty-four of our fellow citizens have been killed while serving there. Today we pay tribute also to them. We feel deeply for their families./////Our thoughts are also with those who, in the interest of us all, are doing important work far from home: our soldiers, police officers, development workers, NGO staff and diplomats. We are grateful to them all. And we are proud of what they are doing./////Our country does not look the other way when human lives are at risk. Germany is helping to bring security to people whose lives are in danger. We are helping to bring freedom to people who still today know only the opposite./////We are doing our share in Yemen, in Somalia and also in the Middle East. Last week I returned from my third visit to the Middle East. We should not delude ourselves that we hold the key to a peaceful solution there. But we want to do all we can to foster and strengthen the fragile process towards a two-state solution./////Our dogged attempts to settle conflicts peacefully should not be mistaken for a lack of realism. There is only a limited amount we can do to stabilize failed or failing states. The real key to ending violence is a yearning for peace among people on the ground and a desire for reconciliation./////Here in Europe in the second half of the twentieth century a new chapter was finally opened, a chapter dedicated to overcoming hatred and promoting reconciliation. That is why it is incumbent on Europeans especially, and us Germans in particular, to strive for mutual understanding and reconciliation throughout the world and thereby help make it a more peaceful place./////Political action encompasses far more than what government does. The dead teach us that the community has a responsibility for each and every individual. They also teach that every individual has a responsibility for the community in which they live. Humanity and compassion are values that make no distinction on the basis of colour or belief. These are the values that must inform the way we live together in Germany and the way Germany acts in the wider world./////The Day of National Mourning enjoins us to recognize the value of human life and the inalienable dignity of every human being for what they are-the most precious thing there is./////",0.1
Human rights,    19.11.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Guido Westerwelle, Member of the German Bundestag and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the second Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum - Federal Foreign Office ",forum,"__ translation of advanced text __/////Mr Janning,Commissioner Fle,Members of Parliament,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,/////I am delighted that you chose Berlin as the venue for your second meeting./////For decades, Berlin stood for the division of Europe. The divide between East and West cut this city in two. For almost 30 years the Berlin Wall stood only a few hundred yards from where you are sitting today. It symbolized the terror that went with the division of Europe and Germany./////I was roughly 14 or 15 years old when my father first took me to Berlin. We went together to the Berlin Wall. Where West Berlin ended, there were wooden platforms from which one could look over the Wall into East Berlin. There were the watchtowers, there was the mined ""death strip"". The Wall revealed the disregard for humanity exercised by a regime that locked its people in and treated them like prisoners./////But Berlin also proved that one cannot lock freedom away for ever. The Berlin Wall did not fall. It was toppled by the people of the East. Since that day, Berlin has no longer stood only for the division of Europe, but first and foremost for the unification of our continent./////Here you are in the right place to reflect on and discuss how best to prevent new divisions arising in Europe. For that is what the Eastern Partnership is all about. Europe does not end at Poland's or Hungary's eastern borders. The Eastern Partnership promotes cooperation beyond the European Union's external borders as a way of ensuring cohesion. We want to ensure that the era of a divided Europe is over once and for all.Ladies and gentlemen,/////The process of European integration is not yet complete. Completing the integration of the EU members from Central and Eastern Europe is one of the biggest tasks we face. Forging closer links with the EU's neighbours is another major task./////The relationship between France and Germany has shown how long-standing hostility can give way to genuine friendship and partnership between neighbours. Farsighted statesmen played a key role in that process./////But it was precisely contacts between individuals from the two sides, for example through the youth exchanges organized by the Franco-German Youth Office, that fostered genuine links between our peoples./////Over the past 20 years, a partnership has likewise taken shape between Germany and Poland, our largest neighbour to the East, which has now evolved into a genuine friendship./////We work closely with Poland, also on foreign policy issues. A few days ago I travelled to Minsk with my Polish counterpart Radek Sikorski. Together we issued a clear call for free and fair presidential elections./////Freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are pan-European values. They bind us together, within the European Union and beyond. It is immaterial whether a state is large or small, an old or new member of our community. All of us in Europe meet as equals. It is in the interest of us all that our neighbours also share these European values./////The aim of the Eastern Partnership is to create a pan-European area of freedom, security, justice and prosperity. The European Union seeks to build on friendship with all its neighbour states./////It is not a question of these states joining the EU. The aim is to support the societies in our immediate neighbourhood as they seek greater freedom, the strengthening of the rule of law, better governance and economic renewal. This is not just in the interest of our neighbours. It is in our pan-European interest./////Germany has always advocated opening the Eastern Partnership to third party involvement. Openness and cooperation have long been the European Union's recipe for success./////That is why I am delighted to see people from Russia and Turkey here with us today. Welcome to Berlin!/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////A pan-European free-trade area could generate new economic momentum. Why not create a common economic space that covers the EU, the Eastern Partnership countries and Russia?/////We must not be afraid of charting new paths. When we enlarged the EU to the east, many people had their misgivings. Some even spoke of the threat it posed to prosperity in Europe. Events have proven these nay-sayers wrong. The eastern enlargement was both a political and an economic success. Both old and new EU members have ultimately gained in economic terms. This should encourage us to push ahead with free trade with the countries to the east of the European Union./////Economic freedom and personal freedom go hand in hand in Europe. Freedom must not remain a vague promise for the distant future. Travel restrictions currently prevent the full realization of the Eastern Partnership countries' social and economic potential. For this reason we need a fresh start in visa policy./////The European Union is an advocate of open, democratic societies with market economies. For us, the unhindered exchange of young people, scientists and business people is an everyday occurrence. Our policies must seek to normalize this freedom in the Eastern Partnership countries, too./////Of course freedom of travel cannot be introduced overnight. Of course we have to take account of security considerations. But security and freedom are not mutually exclusive. I advocate a solution that finds a balance between the two./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The economic and financial crisis has laid bare structural problems in Europe that we must and can resolve. Back in the 1970s Europe was allegedly beset by ""eurosclerosis"". Many people thought European integration had gone as far as it could. But the intervening years have proven otherwise. The present difficulties will also be overcome if we work together. The European Union members are now more closely linked than ever before. We are not only united by the single market and common standards for goods and services. We have also laid the groundwork for a common foreign policy to ensure that Europe's voice can be better heard./////Cohesion is Europe's answer to the changes wrought by globalization. The world order is in flux. Societies in Asia, Latin America and Africa are on the rise. Their political weight is growing accordingly./////Shaping globalization needs more Europe, not less. The centuries of confrontation in Europe have given way to an era of cooperation and integration. Never before in their history have the peoples and states of Europe lived and worked together as peaceably as today. Europeans have never been more united in their values and norms./////We must not however rest on our laurels. Peace, stability and prosperity in Europe are not gifts from above. Nor are they guaranteed until the end of time. We have to keep on working for them./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The Eastern Partnership needs confident stakeholders who advocate freedom and human rights. Change wells up from a society's midst. Charities, churches, environmental groups and human rights organizations drive such changes./////It is up to you to remind politicians of their pledges, to refuse to tolerate corruption, and to demand service and accountability from public authorities and the courts./////The future is in your hands./////I hope that here in Berlin you will be able to establish networks, exchange experience and work together to ensure that the Eastern Partnership strengthens cohesion in Europe.//////////",0.1
Human rights,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Uruguayan weekly ""Busqueda"" - Federal Foreign Office ",Statement,"Germany's economic recovery is not yet stable, and the signals remain contradictory. What is your government's prediction for the rest of this year?/////Exports are rising again, and the German labour market remains resilient. We are sure that the economic recovery will continue in Germany, and we are trying to back this up at national and European level-domestically, we are creating growth impulses by reducing the burden on families and medium-sized businesses./////In 2010 the EU will begin implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, resulting in a major transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the Union in the security and external relations fields. Is it possible to continue that process in the middle of an economic crisis which negatively impacts a large part of the continent?/////Europe's economic and financial crisis management has nothing to do with our efforts to cooperate even more closely on foreign and security policy. I agree that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to major changes in Europe's foreign policy, above all in institutional terms. By combining foreign-policy responsibilities we have the opportunity to present ourselves to a much greater extent as a single actor. The revamped format of ""High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy"", a post Catherine Ashton took over three months ago, will give the EU greater effectiveness and visibility./////Doesn't the fact that some countries fail to adhere to the Maastricht criteria on the coordination of macroeconomic policy make the European economic system less credible?/////The Lisbon Treaty imposes clear requirements on the eurozone members regarding new indebtedness and the level of debt. The Commission makes sure that these requirements are met, and it has the necessary sanction options to bring a member back into line. In my view this system has very much proved its worth, and it is a major factor in the eurozone financial framework's credibility./////The financial crisis which has had serious effects in countries like Greece and Spain, where the central banks are under suspicion for their handling of figures and financial statements regarding budget deficits and debts, has for the first time posed a challenge to the common currency, the euro. What measures will your country propose should this manipulation of data be confirmed?/////Unfortunately, with regard to Greece, it is now clear that the budget and debt figures have been incorrectly reported over a lengthy period. We have to learn the right lessons from this. It is already clear that the Commission, the eurozone members and Eurostat will need to examine national financial data much more closely in future, and that more decisive action must be taken to clarify even the slightest signs of possible irregularities./////This year China will for the first time overtake Germany as the world's leading export nation. How will your country react, in view of the expansion of China and other emerging countries?/////Germany will remain a strong exporting nation, of that I have no doubt. It is of secondary importance whether or not we are still export world champion. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We must maintain our competitiveness and aim for technological leadership. With innovative, high-quality products and technology-for example in the energy, biotechnology and telecommunications sectors-we will bolster our export strength./////For a long time Europe and the United States ignored the lack of democracy and freedoms in China. Has the time now come to confront Beijing with these issues?/////Germany champions freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide, and that is why we openly discuss the difficult situation faced by civil-rights campaigners and dissidents in China or the Tibetans' right to their cultural identity. This was the case during my last visit to Beijing, and it will continue to be the case in future./////Germany is a member of the group of negotiators trying to persuade Iran to abandon its current nuclear development plan. A recent UN report shows that this Islamic state is progressing towards the production of weapons of mass destruction. Does Germany feel the moment has arrived for strict sanctions against the Tehran regime? What kind of sanctions does Germany have in mind?/////While Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes, it cannot arm itself with nuclear weapons. This is why the international negotiating group pursues a dual-track approach, offering Iran broad cooperation in the economic and technological fields in return for an opening by Iran and fulfilment of the international community's demands. Failing this, we reserve the right to take further measures. Germany is also prepared to extend the sanctions should Iran continue to spurn our outstretched hand./////In Cuba a political prisoner has just died during a hunger strike. Do you think Europe should change its policy towards those Latin American countries which fail to fully respect human rights?/////We were greatly saddened at the tragic death of Orlando Zapata that should not have happened. The Cuban Government must finally release all political prisoners and grant international humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails. Standing up for human rights is, by the way, one of the central tenets of German and European foreign policy-also of course with regard to Latin America./////The EU and Mercosur have returned to the negotiating table to make further progress towards signing a free trade agreement. Can an agreement even be reached, given the current economic uncertainty? And can Europe amend its agricultural policy, as called for by Mercosur, in order to conclude an agreement?/////We want an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement with Mercosur. It would be of great value at this particular time, when both sides are keen to stimulate their economies again. As far as European agricultural policy is concerned, there is an important link between the free trade agreement and the Doha Round, which we want to succeed. That is why the EU has made an advance concession and undertaken considerable efforts to ensure improved market access for agricultural products. Progress in the Doha Round would undoubtedly bring progress in the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement too./////What expectations does the German Government have of the Uruguayan Government led by Jose Mujica?/////President Mujica has made clear what the priorities of his term in office will be-creating jobs, combating poverty and undertaking further educational and health-care reforms. Germany wants to further extend its bilateral relations with Uruguay, and following my talks with President Mujica I know that in him Germany has an open and committed interlocutor./////Is Germany concerned that the new Uruguayan Government has announced gestures of rapprochement towards regimes such as that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela?/////Every country has the right to shape its own relations. I don't see anything unusual in Uruguay and Venezuela, two regional partners, being in contact. Uruguay is a member of Mercosur, while Venezuela is on its way to membership./////The German foreign ministry has urged its Uruguayan counterpart to make sure that the Nazi eagle salvaged from the Graf Spee, which still lies wrecked on the bed of the Rio de la Plata, is not exhibited. What is the reason behind this stance, given that in Germany Nazi symbols are exhibited as part of its culture of remembrance? What did you request that the new foreign minister do in this regard?/////We want to prevent parts of the wreckage, and above all the stern eagle and swastika, from entering the militaria trade. Only in this way can we make sure that the wreckage is not misused to glorify or trivialize Nazi thinking. We are of course keen to shed more light on historical events surrounding the Graf Spee, and we therefore propose that the wreckage be exhibited, on the authority of the Uruguayan State, in its proper historical context./////",0.1
Human rights,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
democracy,    06.10.2010 - Speech,Address by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the presentation of the German Africa Award by the German Africa Foundation - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __//////////Dr Chambas,Professor Hornhues,Dr Eid,Dr Kohler,Professor Driftmann,Ms Schaeffer,Ms Diallo,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,//////////Fifty years ago the world gazed spellbound toward Africa. In 1960, the Year of Africa, no less than 17 countries gained independence. 2010 has in its own way also become a Year of Africa./////South Africa seized the FIFA World Cup as an opportunity for the continent as a whole. This global event single-handedly swept away decades' worth of stereotypes./////Germany had a very similar experience four years earlier./////Everyone in this room knows that Africa is much more than poverty, crisis and disaster. Beyond the walls of this room, however, the fact that many economies in Africa are growing just as fast as in Asia is often still overlooked, as is the fact that an increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location, that a new middle class is gradually emerging there. There is good reason why countries such as China are now more present than ever in Africa./////Despite all the challenges, what I see above all when I look at Africa today are major opportunities and untapped potential-economic and political./////African political leaders are taking the continent's fate ever more into their own hands. Regional cooperation is on the rise. The clout of African regional organizations is growing. The principle of ownership is impacting behaviour./////We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper./////We cannot solve the world's most pressing problems without our neighbouring continent Africa./////We need a common response to climate change and its consequences, to development and food security issues, and to the challenges posed by rapidly growing or aging populations./////The time has come for a new turn towards partnership in our Africa policy. Away from a donor-recipient outlook. Towards a global responsibility partnership on equal footing./////The German Government will soon present a comprehensive concept for Africa, which takes into account Africa's changed self-perception as well as our own interests./////We see many young faces in the crowd gathered here today. These are the faces of the graduates of the Federal Foreign Office's first Training for International Diplomats course for French-speaking diplomats from Africa. We bid all of you a heartfelt welcome!/////It is up to your generation to create the new image of Africa and to shape future ties between Germany and Africa. Work with us for peace and development, live out our shared values. We can make freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights into a reality-in Africa, in Europe, and around the world./////Protecting human rights is an inextricable part of the connection between Europe and Africa. Human rights are the indispensable basis on which Europe and Africa can jointly help shape globalization./////Political rights are equal in importance to social and economic rights. For many years Germany has been calling for the United Nations to recognize the right to water as a human right. It is a great success that the General Assembly joined us in this position in July, and the Human Rights Council last week./////Germany has constantly worked to gain a greater say at the United Nations for the countries of the southern hemisphere./////The world is changing-the geopolitical balance is shifting eastward and southward. Africa is a part of these changes./////This holds especially true of peace and security. A Security Council without a strong African presence no longer reflects the current political reality./////We want to reform the Security Council to ensure that Africa is represented among the permanent members./////Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany. There can be no development without peace and security, as evidenced by the conflicts in Côte d'Ivoire, in the Sudan, in Somalia, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo./////That's why Germany promotes the multilateral approaches of the United Nations, the European Union and the G8, which aim for a viable African security architecture./////African security structures must grow stronger so that African solutions to African problems can be found. This is what the African Union expects of itself, an expectation which we strongly support./////The Economic Community of West African States has likewise raised its political profile beyond its original economic orientation. Progress in peace and security is all the more precious at a time when resources are scarce in the countries of West Africa. The trend in the region in recent years has been positive. The tireless work of ECOWAS has borne fruit./////I am extraordinarily pleased that Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas has received this year's German Africa Award./////Dr Chambas, your farsightedness, your courage, your political instincts and your tireless work on behalf of peace and freedom, development and reconciliation have achieved great things in West Africa./////Long before you joined ECOWAS, your reputation as a prudent mediator and conciliator preceded you./////Peaceful settlements in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in Côte d'Ivoire, in Guinea-Bissau and in Togo all bear your mark./////Under your leadership ECOWAS has also worked on solutions to the recent conflicts in Guinea and Niger. We shall miss you very much after your departure from ECOWAS. But I am confident that in other areas you will continue to act with every bit as much determination for the realization of your vision of democracy and the rule of law in West Africa./////It is above all thanks to you that democracy and the rule of law, good governance and human rights are now shared values of all ECOWAS member states./////Security and economic development can succeed only through regional cooperation. This principle has proved its worth in Europe and it is proving its worth in Africa too./////I thank you for your tireless work and unwavering commitment.//////////",0.1

Thank you for your invitation.//////////Here in this House you will be charting Kosovo's path to a democratic and peaceful future.//////////Also as Foreign Minister, I remain a convinced parliamentarian.//////////What's so special about a democracy is not that it has a government.//////////What's so special about a democracy is that there is a parliament in which the whole nation is represented. In a democracy it is parliament that controls the government and not vice versa.//////////In parliament there is both a majority and a minority; that is where supporters of the government and representatives of the opposition debate how best to deal with the problems facing their country. Parliament is the living heart of any democracy. It is here that the nature of the relations between the majority and the minority in a country is decided.//////////As Members of Parliament you bear great responsibility for your country's welfare. You will be judged by Kosovo's citizens by how you live up to this responsibility.//////////I wish you and your still young Parliament a great future.//////////Now the International Court of Justice has delivered its opinion, it is clear that Kosovo's declaration of independence is in accordance with international law.//////////The Court has upheld the interpretation of the law shared also by the German Government.//////////Kosovo's independence does not signify any change in international legal norms.//////////The principles of the sovereign equality of states and the inviolability of borders are not compromised by this decision.//////////Germany was one of the first countries to recognize Kosovo as an independent country. This recognition marked a high point, yet certainly not the end point of our solidarity with the people of Kosovo, our support for a free, democratic, just and dynamic Kosovo.//////////Germany will stand by Kosovo also over the years ahead.//////////The independence of Kosovo closes the chapter of border changes and secession in the area that was once Yugoslavia. The map of the Western Balkans has now been redrawn. The independence of Kosovo and its territorial integrity are practical facts.//////////In the 20th century disputes over borders and areas of settlement served time and again as a pretext for armed attacks, bloodshed, war, murder and genocide on an unimaginable scale.//////////In the Europe of the 21st century there must be no repetition of these tragedies.//////////It is important to remember the past with all its suffering, yet this must not deflect us from building the future.//////////Anyone in Belgrade and Pristina who wields influence and wields this influence responsibly can have no interest in any escalation in Kosovo.//////////I would like to pay tribute to all those who ensured, with a true sense of responsibility, that the situation in Kosovo did not escalate following the country's declaration of independence.//////////I say this also and in particular in the direction of Belgrade and in the direction of the Serbs in Kosovo. I am confident it is now widely recognized that violence and destruction will do no one any good in the long run. To ensure that all ethnic groups in Kosovo can live together in peace is one of the great challenges facing political leaders.//////////With independence, Kosovo-Albanians became the majority population.//////////Every country that recognizes Kosovo does so in the expectation that this new status quo will be used responsibly.//////////The way national minorities are treated is an important yardstick for evaluating how humane a society is. The constitution of 2008 contains all the principles and guarantees needed to ensure that everyone in Kosovo, including the Kosovo Serbs as well as the Roma and all other minorities, can live in security and enjoy the same rights as their fellow citizens.//////////What is crucial now is to translate these constitutional principles into constitutional practice.//////////Kosovo has the means as well as an obligation to promote good relations between the country's different ethnic groups. I very much hope that Kosovo will one day be cited as an example of a functioning multi-ethnic society.//////////Accomplishing this is not going to be easy. Decades of being fettered and oppressed, and of retaliation, too, have inflicted deep wounds.//////////No one is calling for members of minority groups to give up their identities and from one day to the next to see themselves solely as Kosovars. To demand any such thing would also be wrong. A person's identity cannot simply be relabelled. Identity has many different facets. One of them is nationality, others are language, culture and family.//////////The 20th century saw plenty of experiments in which governments sought to make their citizens into the New Man and New Woman. All these experiments involved coercion and all of them failed.//////////The state cannot and must not impose any identity, but it can and must create the framework in which a sense of identity and belonging can grow.//////////That can happen only if all citizens enjoy the same rights and can all rely on the state to protect them.//////////People will feel they belong if they know their name and background is no bar to them becoming a judge or police officer, for example, and hence both a part of and a representative of the state.//////////Every government of Kosovo will also be judged by how far it lives up to its responsibility to protect the Serbian Orthodox monasteries and other cultural monuments here. It is right that this is now the job of Kosovo's police force. Nothing else would in the long term be compatible with Kosovo's sovereignty.//////////In Belgrade people are watching very closely to see how serious the new Republic of Kosovo is about protecting these monasteries and cultural monuments. These sites are part of your shared history, testimony that the Balkans have for centuries been home to many different peoples. I am confident that trust will develop between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the authorities in Kosovo.//////////In the EU and NATO the issue of who should be responsible for the security of the monasteries and cultural monuments was discussed in depth.//////////That KFOR has now handed this responsibility over to the Republic of Kosovo's security forces underlines our confidence in the Kosovo police force and our expectations of its performance. This responsibility means first and foremost an obligation. There must be no repetition of the kind of assaults and violence that took place in March 2004.//////////Reconciliation between the different ethnic groups requires time and patience. The suffering, humiliation, devastation and murder wrought by the Balkan wars must not deflect the region, however, from building a better future.//////////Perhaps only the children born in 2010, members of a generation with no first-hand experience of the past, will be able to feel this legacy as less of a burden. Reconciliation is vital, that is the only way everyone in Kosovo can live in peace and security both now and in the future.//////////The day will come when a representative of Kosovo sits around a table in Brussels with a representative of Serbia to discuss the future of the European Union along with Germany and the other member states.//////////Just a few years ago this would have seemed utopian to most people, but the history of European integration has shown that utopias can become reality.//////////After the devastation wreaked by two World Wars, many probably felt revenge, not reconciliation, was the better course. But despite the indescribable suffering Germany and the Germans had visited on them, Germany's neighbours chose the path of reconciliation.//////////It is impossible to overestimate how important this decision was for Europe's future. Over the decades this spirit of reconciliation generated the mutual trust which made European integration possible.//////////The history of Europe and the history of Germany teach that conflicts must be resolved peacefully. If that fails, in the end it will mean on both sides first and foremost victims, mothers and fathers who have lost sons, girls and boys who have lost fathers and brothers.//////////In Germany especially there was a long and heated debate in 1998 and 1999 over how we should respond to the looming catastrophe in Kosovo. The decision to send Bundeswehr troops into an area that was once Yugoslavia was not one that anyone in Germany took lightly.//////////But just as I am convinced that war signifies political failure, so I am equally convinced that Kosovo today can look forward to a European future because KFOR has done a good job.//////////That is above all due to the soldiers who have served with the Force. They include members of the Bundeswehr, to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks.//////////Today we don't hear much about KFOR outside Kosovo and that's a very good sign. The main stories in the media concern other international issues and conflicts. Violence and clashes in Kosovo are no longer headline news. That shows how successful KFOR has been.//////////Let me encourage you to pursue your road to Europe with confidence and a firm sense of purpose.//////////We all know that on this road towards Europe Kosovo still has tremendous challenges to overcome.//////////Here you can count on Germany's support.//////////Any company will take a close look at the situation in your country before investing money here. Although the recent global economic and financial crisis has not made international investors particularly risk-prone, they are nevertheless keenly interested in making strategic investments. German companies, too, have indicated their interest.//////////The more transparent tendering and procurement procedures are, the more companies will come. Other important factors in attracting investment are independent and functioning courts as well as fair and predictable customs procedures.//////////German support for the development of a multiethnic justice system and police force and an effective customs service helps make investing in Kosovo more attractive.//////////It is crucial that Kosovo should address the problems that are hampering economic growth. In its 2009 progress report the EU Commission noted deficits in combating corruption and organized crime. In this area more still needs to be done.//////////Over the past eleven years Germany has provided Kosovo with 340 million euro in bilateral aid to deal with the consequences of decades of neglect and to help build a new Kosovo.//////////When the banking system collapsed in the aftermath of the fighting, German money helped establish the first post-war bank in your country.//////////Today small and medium-sized enterprises and private households have access to credit.//////////When water and power shortages were a daily problem, Germany stepped in, too. Our Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau KfW is now working with four of the seven regional waterworks to improve the situation.//////////Last year Germany pledged a further 42 million euro in assistance. In the future, too, we will support infrastructure improvement in the form of more long-distance heating and environmentally sound water and power supplies.//////////What is important is that people in Kosovo feel things are moving forward. It is up to the politicians to prove it's worthwhile for them to roll up their sleeves, work hard and build a better future for their country. People need to get out of poverty and into paid work.//////////Women and men with good ideas are already making the most of Kosovo's new economic freedom. Individual initiative and the emergence of a middle class will drive the country's development forward.//////////Even now growth and new opportunities are evident especially in smaller enterprises, in commerce, agriculture, the trades and manufacturing.//////////Kosovo urgently needs economic growth if it is to offer its young people a future. These young men and women need to feel they can make a life for themselves in Kosovo. That's why Germany has since 2007 made education the priority area of our bilateral cooperation. We are advising on how to develop vocational training, on training programmes for teachers and adapting the vocational training system so that it meets local needs as well as normal EU standards.//////////The more Kosovo's young women and young men experience Europe as an area of freedom, the greater the commitment they will bring to building their European future. When I talk of freedom here, I most definitely mean also freedom to travel. The faster reforms become practical reality, the faster Kosovo's citizens can enjoy visa-free travel in Europe.//////////On my way to Pristina I visited Zagreb, Belgrade and Sarajevo. Everyone I talked to there fully realizes that it's good for everyone if their neighbours are prospering.//////////Stability throughout the region is of vital importance to all countries in the Western Balkans. This is a priority for the EU and this is a priority for me, too, as German Foreign Minister. With the necessary basis-good-neighbourly relations-in place, the integration of the Western Balkans countries into euro-atlantic structures can become reality.//////////Kosovo is now already a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group.//////////Germany will continue to work and campaign for the Republic of Kosovo to take its rightful place as soon as possible as a full member of the family of nations. Kosovo's future lies in an integrated Europe.//////////",0.1
democracy,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Uruguayan weekly ""Busqueda"" - Federal Foreign Office ",Statement,"Germany's economic recovery is not yet stable, and the signals remain contradictory. What is your government's prediction for the rest of this year?/////Exports are rising again, and the German labour market remains resilient. We are sure that the economic recovery will continue in Germany, and we are trying to back this up at national and European level-domestically, we are creating growth impulses by reducing the burden on families and medium-sized businesses./////In 2010 the EU will begin implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, resulting in a major transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the Union in the security and external relations fields. Is it possible to continue that process in the middle of an economic crisis which negatively impacts a large part of the continent?/////Europe's economic and financial crisis management has nothing to do with our efforts to cooperate even more closely on foreign and security policy. I agree that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to major changes in Europe's foreign policy, above all in institutional terms. By combining foreign-policy responsibilities we have the opportunity to present ourselves to a much greater extent as a single actor. The revamped format of ""High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy"", a post Catherine Ashton took over three months ago, will give the EU greater effectiveness and visibility./////Doesn't the fact that some countries fail to adhere to the Maastricht criteria on the coordination of macroeconomic policy make the European economic system less credible?/////The Lisbon Treaty imposes clear requirements on the eurozone members regarding new indebtedness and the level of debt. The Commission makes sure that these requirements are met, and it has the necessary sanction options to bring a member back into line. In my view this system has very much proved its worth, and it is a major factor in the eurozone financial framework's credibility./////The financial crisis which has had serious effects in countries like Greece and Spain, where the central banks are under suspicion for their handling of figures and financial statements regarding budget deficits and debts, has for the first time posed a challenge to the common currency, the euro. What measures will your country propose should this manipulation of data be confirmed?/////Unfortunately, with regard to Greece, it is now clear that the budget and debt figures have been incorrectly reported over a lengthy period. We have to learn the right lessons from this. It is already clear that the Commission, the eurozone members and Eurostat will need to examine national financial data much more closely in future, and that more decisive action must be taken to clarify even the slightest signs of possible irregularities./////This year China will for the first time overtake Germany as the world's leading export nation. How will your country react, in view of the expansion of China and other emerging countries?/////Germany will remain a strong exporting nation, of that I have no doubt. It is of secondary importance whether or not we are still export world champion. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We must maintain our competitiveness and aim for technological leadership. With innovative, high-quality products and technology-for example in the energy, biotechnology and telecommunications sectors-we will bolster our export strength./////For a long time Europe and the United States ignored the lack of democracy and freedoms in China. Has the time now come to confront Beijing with these issues?/////Germany champions freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide, and that is why we openly discuss the difficult situation faced by civil-rights campaigners and dissidents in China or the Tibetans' right to their cultural identity. This was the case during my last visit to Beijing, and it will continue to be the case in future./////Germany is a member of the group of negotiators trying to persuade Iran to abandon its current nuclear development plan. A recent UN report shows that this Islamic state is progressing towards the production of weapons of mass destruction. Does Germany feel the moment has arrived for strict sanctions against the Tehran regime? What kind of sanctions does Germany have in mind?/////While Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes, it cannot arm itself with nuclear weapons. This is why the international negotiating group pursues a dual-track approach, offering Iran broad cooperation in the economic and technological fields in return for an opening by Iran and fulfilment of the international community's demands. Failing this, we reserve the right to take further measures. Germany is also prepared to extend the sanctions should Iran continue to spurn our outstretched hand./////In Cuba a political prisoner has just died during a hunger strike. Do you think Europe should change its policy towards those Latin American countries which fail to fully respect human rights?/////We were greatly saddened at the tragic death of Orlando Zapata that should not have happened. The Cuban Government must finally release all political prisoners and grant international humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails. Standing up for human rights is, by the way, one of the central tenets of German and European foreign policy-also of course with regard to Latin America./////The EU and Mercosur have returned to the negotiating table to make further progress towards signing a free trade agreement. Can an agreement even be reached, given the current economic uncertainty? And can Europe amend its agricultural policy, as called for by Mercosur, in order to conclude an agreement?/////We want an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement with Mercosur. It would be of great value at this particular time, when both sides are keen to stimulate their economies again. As far as European agricultural policy is concerned, there is an important link between the free trade agreement and the Doha Round, which we want to succeed. That is why the EU has made an advance concession and undertaken considerable efforts to ensure improved market access for agricultural products. Progress in the Doha Round would undoubtedly bring progress in the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement too./////What expectations does the German Government have of the Uruguayan Government led by Jose Mujica?/////President Mujica has made clear what the priorities of his term in office will be-creating jobs, combating poverty and undertaking further educational and health-care reforms. Germany wants to further extend its bilateral relations with Uruguay, and following my talks with President Mujica I know that in him Germany has an open and committed interlocutor./////Is Germany concerned that the new Uruguayan Government has announced gestures of rapprochement towards regimes such as that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela?/////Every country has the right to shape its own relations. I don't see anything unusual in Uruguay and Venezuela, two regional partners, being in contact. Uruguay is a member of Mercosur, while Venezuela is on its way to membership./////The German foreign ministry has urged its Uruguayan counterpart to make sure that the Nazi eagle salvaged from the Graf Spee, which still lies wrecked on the bed of the Rio de la Plata, is not exhibited. What is the reason behind this stance, given that in Germany Nazi symbols are exhibited as part of its culture of remembrance? What did you request that the new foreign minister do in this regard?/////We want to prevent parts of the wreckage, and above all the stern eagle and swastika, from entering the militaria trade. Only in this way can we make sure that the wreckage is not misused to glorify or trivialize Nazi thinking. We are of course keen to shed more light on historical events surrounding the Graf Spee, and we therefore propose that the wreckage be exhibited, on the authority of the Uruguayan State, in its proper historical context./////",0.1
democracy,    19.11.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Guido Westerwelle, Member of the German Bundestag and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the second Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum - Federal Foreign Office ",forum,"__ translation of advanced text __/////Mr Janning,Commissioner Fle,Members of Parliament,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,/////I am delighted that you chose Berlin as the venue for your second meeting./////For decades, Berlin stood for the division of Europe. The divide between East and West cut this city in two. For almost 30 years the Berlin Wall stood only a few hundred yards from where you are sitting today. It symbolized the terror that went with the division of Europe and Germany./////I was roughly 14 or 15 years old when my father first took me to Berlin. We went together to the Berlin Wall. Where West Berlin ended, there were wooden platforms from which one could look over the Wall into East Berlin. There were the watchtowers, there was the mined ""death strip"". The Wall revealed the disregard for humanity exercised by a regime that locked its people in and treated them like prisoners./////But Berlin also proved that one cannot lock freedom away for ever. The Berlin Wall did not fall. It was toppled by the people of the East. Since that day, Berlin has no longer stood only for the division of Europe, but first and foremost for the unification of our continent./////Here you are in the right place to reflect on and discuss how best to prevent new divisions arising in Europe. For that is what the Eastern Partnership is all about. Europe does not end at Poland's or Hungary's eastern borders. The Eastern Partnership promotes cooperation beyond the European Union's external borders as a way of ensuring cohesion. We want to ensure that the era of a divided Europe is over once and for all.Ladies and gentlemen,/////The process of European integration is not yet complete. Completing the integration of the EU members from Central and Eastern Europe is one of the biggest tasks we face. Forging closer links with the EU's neighbours is another major task./////The relationship between France and Germany has shown how long-standing hostility can give way to genuine friendship and partnership between neighbours. Farsighted statesmen played a key role in that process./////But it was precisely contacts between individuals from the two sides, for example through the youth exchanges organized by the Franco-German Youth Office, that fostered genuine links between our peoples./////Over the past 20 years, a partnership has likewise taken shape between Germany and Poland, our largest neighbour to the East, which has now evolved into a genuine friendship./////We work closely with Poland, also on foreign policy issues. A few days ago I travelled to Minsk with my Polish counterpart Radek Sikorski. Together we issued a clear call for free and fair presidential elections./////Freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights are pan-European values. They bind us together, within the European Union and beyond. It is immaterial whether a state is large or small, an old or new member of our community. All of us in Europe meet as equals. It is in the interest of us all that our neighbours also share these European values./////The aim of the Eastern Partnership is to create a pan-European area of freedom, security, justice and prosperity. The European Union seeks to build on friendship with all its neighbour states./////It is not a question of these states joining the EU. The aim is to support the societies in our immediate neighbourhood as they seek greater freedom, the strengthening of the rule of law, better governance and economic renewal. This is not just in the interest of our neighbours. It is in our pan-European interest./////Germany has always advocated opening the Eastern Partnership to third party involvement. Openness and cooperation have long been the European Union's recipe for success./////That is why I am delighted to see people from Russia and Turkey here with us today. Welcome to Berlin!/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////A pan-European free-trade area could generate new economic momentum. Why not create a common economic space that covers the EU, the Eastern Partnership countries and Russia?/////We must not be afraid of charting new paths. When we enlarged the EU to the east, many people had their misgivings. Some even spoke of the threat it posed to prosperity in Europe. Events have proven these nay-sayers wrong. The eastern enlargement was both a political and an economic success. Both old and new EU members have ultimately gained in economic terms. This should encourage us to push ahead with free trade with the countries to the east of the European Union./////Economic freedom and personal freedom go hand in hand in Europe. Freedom must not remain a vague promise for the distant future. Travel restrictions currently prevent the full realization of the Eastern Partnership countries' social and economic potential. For this reason we need a fresh start in visa policy./////The European Union is an advocate of open, democratic societies with market economies. For us, the unhindered exchange of young people, scientists and business people is an everyday occurrence. Our policies must seek to normalize this freedom in the Eastern Partnership countries, too./////Of course freedom of travel cannot be introduced overnight. Of course we have to take account of security considerations. But security and freedom are not mutually exclusive. I advocate a solution that finds a balance between the two./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The economic and financial crisis has laid bare structural problems in Europe that we must and can resolve. Back in the 1970s Europe was allegedly beset by ""eurosclerosis"". Many people thought European integration had gone as far as it could. But the intervening years have proven otherwise. The present difficulties will also be overcome if we work together. The European Union members are now more closely linked than ever before. We are not only united by the single market and common standards for goods and services. We have also laid the groundwork for a common foreign policy to ensure that Europe's voice can be better heard./////Cohesion is Europe's answer to the changes wrought by globalization. The world order is in flux. Societies in Asia, Latin America and Africa are on the rise. Their political weight is growing accordingly./////Shaping globalization needs more Europe, not less. The centuries of confrontation in Europe have given way to an era of cooperation and integration. Never before in their history have the peoples and states of Europe lived and worked together as peaceably as today. Europeans have never been more united in their values and norms./////We must not however rest on our laurels. Peace, stability and prosperity in Europe are not gifts from above. Nor are they guaranteed until the end of time. We have to keep on working for them./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The Eastern Partnership needs confident stakeholders who advocate freedom and human rights. Change wells up from a society's midst. Charities, churches, environmental groups and human rights organizations drive such changes./////It is up to you to remind politicians of their pledges, to refuse to tolerate corruption, and to demand service and accountability from public authorities and the courts./////The future is in your hands./////I hope that here in Berlin you will be able to establish networks, exchange experience and work together to ensure that the Eastern Partnership strengthens cohesion in Europe.//////////",0.3
democracy,    22.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the opening ceremony of the Nuremberg Trials Memorial - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advanced text __/////Minister Lavrov,Mr Dumas,Prosecutor-General Grieve,Ambassador Rapp,Mr Ferencz,Mayor Maly,Minister of State Neumann,Minister of Justice Merk,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,/////The Second World War ended more than 65 years ago. Now is the time to ask questions of those who experienced this era first-hand. Whatever we neglect to ask today will remain forever unasked-and unanswered./////That's why I am so especially pleased that Benjamin Ferencz will be speaking to us here today. Mr Ferencz, thank you for this./////The Nuremberg Trials were a response to the perversion of the law in National Socialist Germany. By passing the Enabling Act, the Nazis abolished democracy./////Discrimination against Jewish civil servants was called the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service./////When it enacted the Nuremberg race laws, Nazi Germany broke with the fundamental principle that all people are equal before the law. Jewish assets were stolen by the financial authorities on the basis of laws and ordinances./////The regime concealed terror and tyranny behind the mask of law and justice, and the consequence was endless suffering and the murder of millions./////In those days many wondered if those who had so blatantly trampled justice underfoot were themselves entitled to just treatment./////It is a great historic achievement that the Allies resisted the temptation to exact revenge. Revenge would have been the easiest path. But the Allies decided on the more difficult path. They charted new territory for law and for civilization by attempting to make inconceivable crimes the object of a trial. They sought and found answers to difficult political, moral and legal questions./////Who was to sit on the judges' bench, only Allied judges or Germans too?/////What law was to be applied? The trials raised questions about the criminal liability of individuals who had acted as organs of the state and the extent of the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation./////Because much was ventured here in Nuremberg-in political, legal and human terms-international law was able to progress and standards for future cases were established./////The Nuremberg Trials had no precedent, no guiding example to turn to. The Trials themselves blazed the trail for the development of international criminal law, a process which is still far from complete./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Excellencies,/////Article 1 of the German Basic Law proclaims, and I quote, ""Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority./////The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.""/////With these words the authors of the Basic Law drew a lesson for the Federal Republic from the darkest chapter of German history. The individual person is central to our constitutional order. The state must serve the individual and not the other way around. This holds true for Germany, for Europe and as a universal principle. Only the worldwide protection of human rights can prevent our world from coming undone./////It is also our history that has given rise to the German Government's obligation to advocate for human rights both in Germany and around the world./////No verdict can undo the suffering of the victims. No courtroom sentence can bring the dead back to life./////But bringing the perpetrators to trial is nonetheless important, and not only for the direct victims of the crime. The impact of a judgement based on the rule of law reaches far beyond the trial itself./////The founding of the United Nations was the ambitious attempt to counter our tumultuous world with legal structures. We all know how incomplete this task remains, but the United Nations can only be as strong as its member states allow. Germany remains committed to the goal of strengthening the rule of law in international relations. The strength of international law is the measure of our actions in the United Nations, and also in the United Nations Security Council. This is a laborious process, and we move forward only in small steps, but there is no reason to let ourselves grow discouraged./////Sixty years after the Nuremberg Trials, international criminal justice is a permanent part of international law. 114 countries have accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. We will persevere in our efforts to increase this number. We will also work for the decisions of the International Criminal Court to be applied. Germany's past has taught us how thin the veneer of our civilization is. Learning this lesson was and is our responsibility. It is no small victory that the International Criminal Court in The Hague now sends the message that political leaders must answer for their deeds-and especially for their wrongdoings./////Citizens of Europe can turn directly to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg if the country in which they live impinges upon their rights. Similar legal protection beyond the borders of Europe is an ambitious but worthy goal, and is worth fighting for. Overcoming the law of the jungle, the rule of the strong, is one of the greatest achievements of our civilization. We must accomplish the same internationally./////We want to overcome the rule of the strong by strengthening the rule of law. Step by step, and in international politics too./////The confrontation with one's own past is never complete, uncomfortable as this may be for some. The tremendous extent to which the past seeps into the present is demonstrated by the attention that the newest publication on the history of the Federal Foreign Office has recently garnered./////It is important for us to keep sight of the past. Whoever does not know the past cannot take from it any lessons for the future. It is not the duty of the young to enquire about the past, it is the duty of the older generation to take the initiative to speak about it./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////The city of Nuremberg has done a great deal to further a culture of remembrance. Mayor Maly, I'm quite pleased that the Nuremberg city council has applied for this room to be added to the World Heritage list./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Excellencies,/////It was only yesterday that the Foreign Ministers of Russia, France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany sat together at a table at the NATO summit in Lisbon. This is not something to be taken for granted./////We come together not as victor and vanquished, and also not as East and West. We are partners, and for that we are eternally grateful to those among you who represent these countries, as it was by no means self-evident that you would respectfully accept Germany back into the peaceful international community after what it had done to the world in the first half of the twentieth century./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////From Vancouver to Vladivostok, we are united today by the shared pursuit of security./////Our goal is a strategic partnership that serves the interests of all./////We are experiencing Europe in an era of which generations before us dreamed in vain. We live in a Europe of peace and prosperity. Safeguarding these conditions is our shared responsibility./////Europe too is a lesson from our history. The European model of cooperation is hard work. With its all-night negotiating sessions, it takes a great deal of energy. But redressing the consequences of confrontation would be much more difficult and much more dramatic. Let us appreciate the Europe we have. I say this here in this place as a lesson of history, and I say it expressly in light of certain current discussions. Those who only ask how much something costs sometimes lose sight of how much it's worth./////Freedom, law and justice don't come about of their own accord. They must be struggled for./////We cherish the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. We owe it to them to prevent war and genocide, both within and beyond Europe./////The Nuremberg Trials were a start. The Rome Statute was a good continuation. And the establishment of the International Criminal Court in The Hague was not the end. Our shared responsibility remains: to stand up for peace, for freedom and for human rights.//////////",0.1
democracy,    29.03.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Federal Minister Westerwelle at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 29 March 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __//////////Lieber Herr Breitschwerdt,/////Ihnen und den Mitgliedern der deutsch-kanadischen Handelskammer ganz herzlichen Dank fr die Einladung zu diesem Festakt.//////////Minister Pupatello, Minister Van Loan,/////President Naylor,/////It is a real honour and pleasure to be here with you. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today at this eminent University, in this dynamic city, in this huge province and beautiful country./////Canada is known worldwide as a tolerant and open-minded country. As host of the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games Canada was the focus for all sports fans around the world. Let me thank Canada for such wonderful Games. Once more Canada has lived up to its high reputation and presented itself as a wonderful host. And I am happy to congratulate Canada on its first position in the medal table. By the way, Germany came in second./////Ladies and Gentlemen,/////In purely geographical terms Canada and Germany are far apart. But when it comes to our values and our interests Canada and Germany are very close. Our two countries share the same fundamental values. These include democracy and the rule of law, the need for international cooperation and the primacy of international law. We share a similar understanding of the value of individual freedom. All of these values bind us together./////To defend these common values Canadian Forces were based in Germany for four decades. From 1954 to 1994 Canadian men and women helped us to confront Communism along the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. More than 400.000 Canadians lived in Germany to protect our shared free and democratic ideals. We thank you for your staunch support and your strong friendship./////And it was here in Canada, in Ottawa, at the Open Skies Conference in 1990, that the process of negotiating the Two plus Four Agreement was started. This year we celebrate with gratitude the 20th anniversary of German Unification./////That you had an event here to commemorate the beginning of the Two plus Four process is something I really appreciate./////Let me assure you: The German people will not forget the part Canada played in bringing down the Berlin Wall and in the unification of our country. Some people speak of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, but the Wall did not fall, people brought it down. We will always be very grateful to Canada./////German foreign policy is value-based and interest-led. That is not a contradiction but the two sides of the same coin. The German-Canadian relationship reflects this combination in a unique manner. Our relationship is not only based on shared values, but also on shared interests./////Both our countries are major economic powers, both are heavily dependent on exports. More than many other countries Germany and Canada have to be concerned about the lurking dangers of protectionism. All countries profit from free trade. But more than elsewhere our prosperity is a result of free access to foreign markets./////Both of us face competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Our two countries cannot-and don't want to-compete on salaries or social and environmental standards with those countries. The cheaper the products from those countries, the better and more advanced our products have to be. More than many other countries Canada and Germany have to stay at the forefront of research and development to maintain prosperity./////This year we celebrate one hundred years of Canadian-German trade relations./////Today our bilateral annual trade volume adds up to more than 10 billion Euros. The EU is Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. Canadian-German trade relations are a success story. But there is still potential for further growth./////As Minister for Foreign Affairs I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal. Soon after taking office I saw to it that strategies were developed with the aim of enhancing Germany's external economic policy. We want to open up external economic promotion to other sectors and make it more attractive to small and medium__ized companies in particular. These form the backbone of the German economy. Let me assure you: I will pursue external economic promotion not with timidity but with vigor. In other words, I will do it the Canadian way. It is no accident that your foreign ministry is called ""Department for Foreign Affairs and International Trade""./////In a globalized world it is not enough for countries like Canada and Germany just to expand their trade volume. We have to deepen our trade relations./////That is why in 2007, when Germany held the Presidency of the European Union, we lobbied hard to get the EU to work with Canada on a ""Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"". Both sides have been doing their homework. Formal discussions have begun and are going well. They take us into new territory for our bilateral relations. To meet the goals we have set, we have to look at investment rules; at provincial as well as federal government procurement; at regulations; at intellectual property rights; at local competition policies; at labour and environment issues. We may not be able to agree on everything but a substantial agreement will not only be a major boost to Canadian-European trade, but also to the German and Canadian position on the global market./////Both our countries will only be able to keep their positions at the forefront of prosperous states if we make sure that we maintain our position at the high end of the value chain./////To do that, we have to invest heavily in education, in innovation, in science and in research and in development. The answer is to use our advantages, to bring out the very best that we can offer to the world. And, more and more, that is something we do in partnership with other countries./////Just one example: Research in Motion and their latest Blackberry: They came up with a keyboard that is very small and still easy to use because every single letter is cleverly and differently shaped. That was invented at RIM's new facility in Bochum, Germany./////And there are many other similar examples./////By combining the best of research and science in many countries we stay competitive in a globalized world. In that respect, Germany, the EU and Canada have a lot to offer each other./////Education is the number one priority in both our countries. The new German government will invest an extra 12 billion Euro in education, research and development. But improving educational institutions is not only a question of money. It is also a question of structures./////Business schools have long talked about ""best practices"". Learning from each other about what works and what does not./////One very good example of ""best practices"" is the award given in 2008 by the Bertelsmann Foundation, one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany, to the Toronto District School Board for its work in providing fair and equal opportunities for all children. At the awards ceremony, the Foundation said: ""The school system in Toronto shows us what actions we have to take, considering the challenges we are facing from globalization, migration and demographic change"". Using the experience of Toronto, the Foundation has launched its own programme in Germany called ""Integration Through Education""./////I think this is the way forward. As the challenges we face grow more complex, we all profit from looking for solutions also beyond our borders./////The global economic and financial crisis has not led to a slowing down or halt in the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely because of a lack of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must prevent global problems from turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops on the basis of a set of rules and values. Let me underline this: Our shared goal must be to give globalization a set of rules and values so that peace, security and prosperity are safeguarded in the long term./////Here we see Canada as a natural partner, because we share the same fundamental values and interests./////As I am travelling to the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today, let me point out just two topics Canada and Germany are dealing with side by side right now at the global level://///Both Germany and Canada have a strong interest in nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. As countries that do not possess nuclear weapons we want to contribute to strengthening the international regime against the proliferation of nuclear weapons while making nuclear technology available for peaceful uses. I am therefore pleased that the Canadian G8 Presidency has made non-proliferation a priority issue at our meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today and tomorrow./////A related and very important issue at the G8 meeting will be the nuclear dispute with Iran. We are very concerned about Iran's unwillingness and inability to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. I would like to underline that we are not against Iran using nuclear power for the peaceful production of energy. We have offered a generous package of assistance in exchange for assurances. But the Iranian leadership should understand that we cannot and will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. It would constitute a major threat to regional stability but it would also undermine the global non-proliferation regime. Our hand to Iran remains outstretched. But in the absence of a response and real progress the international community has to prepare stronger sanctions against Iran. We will discuss the situation and the way forward at our meeting tomorrow./////Canada and Germany are long term partners, on the bilateral and the global level./////We may be on two different continents but on the major challenges of our time we stand as one./////Over the last century our relations have been deepened, improved and strengthened. I am very optimistic that we will continue in that direction in the future. Not only because our governments agree upon many topics, but because of the deep friendship between our peoples./////Thank you very much./////",0.1
democracy,    21.05.2010 - Interview,Interview: Guido Westerwelle in the newspaper Al Hayat - Federal Foreign Office ,Statement,"You are heading in a new visit to the Middle East. Can you tell us what you hope to achieve from this current visit to Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan and Syria? What are the main issues you are going to discuss with the leaders of these countries?/////My visit to the region is happening at just the right time. With the first newly launched indirect peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians for some time we now have a positive dynamism in the process again. Yet the situation on the ground remains tense and fragile. That is why we also need a constructive regional backdrop to keep hold of the chance of urgently needed direct negotiations. I want to work for this in my talks in the region. After all, what we are ultimately talking about is a comprehensive peace solution which also takes in other spheres of conflict in the Middle East, that is also the unresolved conflicts between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon./////Germany is expected to inaugurate this week the new German-Palestinian Steering Committee with Prime Minister Fayyad. What will this committee do, and does Germany hope of playing any role in mediating between the Israelis and the Palestinians?/////The German-Palestinian Steering Committee is a first. No other country has a forum with the Palestinian Authority in which the ministers of the two Cabinets consult on further institution-building in the Palestinian territories. If there is to be peace in the Middle East, there is no alternative to a just two-state solution. So this can happen we need, alongside the political process, to work on practical institution-building. We are doing what we can here to support the Palestinian Authority under Prime Minister Fayyad's leadership. With the joint Steering Committee, we want to deepen and better dovetail our long-standing commitment in the Palestinian territories./////As a follow up, do you concede that the Americans are now the only main player in this mediation (through the proximity talks)?/////We in the international community want to provide the best possible support for the peace efforts on the ground. Traditionally the United States plays a major role as a member of the Middle East Quartet. Thanks to George Mitchell's work, we have now managed to get the Israelis and Palestinians to talk to one another again-albeit only through the United States initially. No-one can afford a continued standstill in the Middle East. The parties to the conflict should therefore use the opportunity presented by the indirect peace talks./////Some critics may say that you are bias in favour of Israel because of the guilt you still feel towards the Jews from the Nazi era. What can you say to prove those critics wrong?/////The close partnership with Israel is a cornerstone of German foreign policy. But that doesn't exclude us supporting the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. After all, we believe the only long-term solution for the Middle East conflict lies in a two-state solution and the recognition of Israel by its Arab neighbours./////Also as a follow up, those critics may point towards your failure to stop Israel from building illegal settlements on occupied territories, especially Jerusalem. Why can't you put enough pressure on Israel to stop these illegal buildings?/////Our position on the settlement question is just as clear as that of the EU and the entire international community. The roadmap provides for a freeze on settlements-this applies to both the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A few months ago the Israeli Government agreed on a settlement moratorium. This was an important first step which opened the way for indirect peace talks. But this still means we need further progress on the settlement issue./////The Quartet set some conditions on Hamas after it won the elections in 2006. Do you see any relevance to sticking to these conditions, which Hamas consistently refused to accept?/////The criteria of the Middle East Quartet remain unchanged: We demand the cessation of violence and the recognition of Israel's right to exist and of the results to date in the peace process.That remains our yardstick when it comes to Hamas./////With Senator Mitchell taking the lead role in the negotiations between the Israeli and the Palestinians, do you still see a role for the Quartet's Special Envoy Tony Blair?/////During the German Presidency of the EU, the Middle East Quartet was successfully drawn in more to efforts to reach a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The Quartet is and remains a central forum for the peace process in which the EU, the United States, Russia and the United Nations can coordinate. The most recent Quartet statement issued at its meeting in Moscow proves it works well./////What is your position on the blockade against Gaza?/////Those wanting peace need to tangibly improve the daily lives of the people. This is particularly true of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip which is increasingly precarious. That is why it is particularly important to improve people's access to the basic goods they need for their everyday lives. We finally need constructive solutions here./////On Egypt: The Egyptian government seems to be very sensitive to criticism on its record of reform and democracy, especially after the recent renewal of the emergency law. What is your position on this issue, and on the need to open up the political space for the opposition to be able to put forward independent candidates for the next presidential elections?/////Let me say here that Egypt is a major anchor of stability in the entire Middle East region. We appreciate its constructive commitment, for example on the Middle East peace process. Of course we encourage Egypt to continue its internal reform efforts./////On Lebanon: what kind of help are you willing to give the Lebanese government, including assistance in the military and intelligence fields (training, equipment etc)? What is your view on the role played by Hizbullah, which the EU considers its military wing a terrorist organization, although the party is part of the government of prime minister Saad Harriri./////For some time now, Germany has been helping Lebanon secure its land and maritime borders. At the same time we are supporting the country's reconstruction following the war in the summer of 2006 and are helping improve the living conditions in the Palestinian refugee camps. As far as our view on Hizbullah is concerned, the German Government has no political contacts with it./////On Syria: Much was said about Syria's 'negative' role in the region-allowing Jihadists to cross over to Iraq, supporting Palestinian terrorist organizations based in Damascus, etc. Has Syria changed its policies, or has it been you who have changed yours after it failed to force Syria to change its policies?/////In recent years, Syria has fortunately moved forward. This is reflected for example in the ongoing normalization of relations with Lebanon. We worked to bring this about together with our partners in the EU. More constructive steps are needed. At the same time, dialogue with Damascus is crucial if we want to move closer to solving the Middle East conflict./////Also on Syria: there have been a lot of calls on Syria to halt its alliance with Iran. Do you see any problems with such a special relationship between Syria and Iran?/////Syria has to decide itself on the intensity of its relations with Iran. What we want to do is bolster the peace-seeking forces in the region and encourage everyone in the region, including Syria, to play a constructive role./////What role can Jordan play in helping to solve the Arab-Israeli issue?/////Jordan plays a key role in the Middle East peace process. More than half the Jordanian population is of Palestinian origin. Each and every setback in Israeli-Palestinian relations has a direct impact on Jordanian domestic policy. This is not an easy situation but Jordan takes a constructive approach by constantly working for a balancing-out of interests with its neighbours including Israel. That is another reason why Amman is an important interlocutor for us.///////////////",0.1
Peace in the Middle East,    30.10.2010 - Speech,Presentation of the Peace of Westphalia Prize to Daniel Barenboim and the young musicians of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Mnster on 30 October 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advanced text __/////Daniel Barenboim,Musicians of the ""West-Eastern Divan-Orchestra"",Ladies and gentlemen,/////It is my pleasure to welcome you all to Mnster today. Mnster is not just a lively university city. It is not just an economically flourishing city. Mnster is a city of peace./////In 1648 the Peace of Westphalia brought to an end decades of war and destruction in Germany and Europe. For the first time in Europe's history, peace was attained through negotiation. The cities of Mnster and Osnabrck stand for peace and reconciliation./////The Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War. But, as we all know, that was by no means the last war on our continent./////In Mnster, as in many other European cities, the effects of the confrontation which for decades divided our continent and caused people immeasurable suffering are still clearly visible./////One of the historic achievements of those who held positions of responsibility before us is the fact that we in Europe have been able to place the model of confrontation with the model of cooperation. Cooperation can be difficult. It requires a great deal of patience and strong nerves-as I can tell you from my own experience after a few marathon sessions in Brussels. But anyone familiar with the consequences of confrontation knows that cooperation is worth any amount of effort./////Today some people talk quite nonchalantly about Europe. But it is my belief that we cannot appreciate Europe highly enough; Europe is a great peace and freedom project. Even if Europe had given us nothing more than decades of peace, it would still have been worth it./////We Europeans cannot prescribe to anyone else in the world how to find peace. But one thing we can do: by putting the model of European cooperation into practice in our daily lives we can show that it works. Cooperation rather than confrontation-that is the lesson we learn from our own history./////Daniel Barenboim,/////I have today the particular privilege to honour you as a world-famous artist, as an outstanding pianist and conductor, as a true citizen of the world and as someone who is wholeheartedly committed to cooperation./////Along with the late Palestinian literary scholar Edward Said, you established the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra./////An orchestra is by its very nature an expression of the concept of cooperation. In an orchestra no one instrument is more or less important than the others. Every instrument is unique. The first violin differs from the second violin merely in its tone colour. Only when every tone is heard can the orchestra produce its best sound./////The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra embodies the idea of cooperation in another very special way too: under your direction, highly-gifted young musicians from Jordan and Syria, from Lebanon and Egypt, from Israel and Palestine, together play the works of great composers. Truly, the orchestra is an ensemble without boundaries./////Under your leadership, young people whose parents cannot be reconciled across borders join together to make music. With the help of music they try to overcome this silence./////You yourself have described the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra as an ""independent republic"". This independent republic brings together people who would probably never have met otherwise. Young people from different states and cultures learn from each other, hearing viewpoints with which they had previously had no contact. This can be painful, if it casts doubt on one's own previous perceptions. It can also be a relief when one suddenly discovers unexpected similarities. It certainly increases understanding of each other, even if afterwards one has to agree to disagree. This mutual understanding is the basis for compromise. And compromise is the basis for peace./////The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra lives out the ideal of a peaceful society of coexistence characterized by mutual respect and tolerance./////Daniel Barenboim,/////You are being presented today with the Peace of Westphalia Prize in recognition of your endeavours both as an artist and as a citizen to bring about reconciliation in the Middle East. You are being honoured because you and your orchestra overcome divisions and establish common ground. You are receiving this award today because you are a peace activist in the best sense of the word://///You are active for peace, even if, in the eleven years of the orchestra's existence, you have often been criticized and met with hostility from many sides. For some people the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra breaks a taboo./////Let me just recall your orchestra's legendary concert in Ramallah in 2005. It was, for obvious reasons, a bold move at the time. In the run-up to the concert, Spain and Germany enjoyed exemplary cooperation. I cannot and don't wish to go into details here today. I'll just say this: with a great deal of imagination, with courage, determination and passion, the concert did go ahead in the end, under heavy security./////For us and for many others in the world, your orchestra is a sensation./////The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra attracts fans not only because of the music, but because it embodies on a small scale what we long for on a large scale: peace in the Middle East./////In a few days I will be setting off on my third visit to the Middle East. We should not delude ourselves that we have the key to a peaceful solution in our hands. But we want to do all we can to foster and strengthen the fragile process towards a two-state solution./////We hold Israel's security to be non-negotiable. Only a solution which guarantees Israel an existence within secure borders and at the same time ensures the establishment of a viable Palestinian state can bring lasting peace./////That's why the direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be continued. There is no sensible alternative. Unilateral steps don't bring us any closer to a lasting peace settlement. This can only be achieved if both sides make concessions and compromises. I am not underestimating the challenges. But I very much hope that all involved will have the farsightedness and courage to take the necessary steps. Germany has a responsibility to support this process to the utmost./////Let me give you a concrete example: alongside the negotiations, the two-state solution needs a second pillar, namely the development of functioning state structures in the Palestinian territories. Supporting this is a particular priority for Germany. That's why, in May, we were the first country in Europe to set up a German-Palestinian Steering Committee at ministerial level. The Committee held its second meeting in Ramallah a couple of days ago, on 28 October. The bilateral Steering Committee shows that we are serious in our support for future Palestinian statehood.I am pleased that several European partners are now following our example./////Nobody should mistake our dogged endeavours towards peace in the Middle East for a lack of realism. Our possibilities are limited. But we can provide support. The most important prerequisite for ending violence remains the yearning for peace and readiness for reconciliation of the people themselves./////Daniel Barenboim, you once said that music, while producing rapprochements and friendships which would otherwise be inconceivable, cannot solve the problems of the Middle East./////That may be a realistic assessment. With your work, however, you are sending a signal of reconciliation and giving wings to the desire for peace of all those who have the pleasure of hearing the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. That isa contribution to the peace process in the Middle East./////For peace is inconceivable without the involvement of the people. Often it is the commitment of civil society which succeeds in building the first bridges, which creates a feeling of closeness, which makes peace possible at all. Reconciliation between governments must be accompanied by reconciliation between peoples. Otherwise there can be no lasting peace./////Dear musicians of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, dear Daniel Barenboim,/////Today you are receiving the Peace of Westphalia Prize in recognition of your work to promote mutual understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. You are helping to smooth the way for a just and peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to peace in the Middle East./////Your commitment, however, has an impact outside the region too. Mutual understanding, respect and tolerance are values which you put into practice and which should determine human interactions all over the world./////Many congratulations!//////////",0.1

Peace in the Middle East,    10.06.2010 - Speech,Address to the German Bundestag by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on Germany's participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,/////Current events in the Middle East show just how difficult it is to make political headway in the conflict there. We discussed this issue in detail yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I'm sure we agree that it is therefore all the more important for the international community and indeed Germany, as part of that community, to maintain its commitment to peace and security in the region./////Germany has a vital strategic interest in lasting peace in the Middle East. The key elements needed to achieve that overarching goal are the security of the State of Israel, the creation of a viable Palestinian state, and of course not least the strengthening of Lebanon's sovereignty and stability./////Over the past two years that country's domestic political situation has further stabilized due to the success of the parliamentary elections, the formation of a government of national unity led by Prime Minister Hariri, and the holding of local elections. I therefore want to stress that the UN's commitment in the form of UNIFIL has doubtlessly played a decisive role in this stabilization./////During my recent visit to Lebanon my talks with the political leadership, the UNIFIL commanders and the German troops serving there made it clear to me how important our contribution still is to the creation of an independent Lebanese coastguard force./////Last December, when asking this House to extend the UNIFIL mandate, I pointed out that the UN was about to evaluate the mission. That evaluation has now taken place. It was completed this spring. As a result the UN Secretary-General, in summing up, stated that while the UNIFIL naval element remained necessary, it could not, just as the mission as a whole, be continued indefinitely./////With this in mind, we are asking for an extension of Germany's participation in the UNIFIL naval element for another year. But let me state here and now that we don't wish to merely continue our mission off the Lebanese coast. The mandate is now a new one in terms of both quality and quantity, and it also contains a clear prospect of withdrawal./////The manpower ceiling for German participation in the UNIFIL naval element will be reduced from 800 to 300 troops, i.e. more than halved. Less than 300 soldiers are deployed and serving there at the moment. The focus of that participation from now on will be on training and improving the operational capabilities of Lebanon's naval forces./////The aim of the German mission is to put the Lebanese naval forces into a position to protect their own maritime borders as soon as possible. This must be the key aim of the new mandate. If we want to fix a date for withdrawal, we must make sure that the local forces are able to take on the German troops' tasks. This is why the mandate's new focus is on basic and further training./////Lebanon has made significant progress in this field since 2008. This is above all clear to those of you in this House who have visited the country. I think we can agree that the Lebanese Navy doesn't yet have the necessary overall capabilities./////Many of you have been to Lebanon; you've visited UNIFIL, and you know that a contribution is still needed not only in terms of training but also of equipment for maritime border protection to work at all. As soon as these gaps have been filled, in other words when Lebanon can protect its own maritime borders, we plan to end the mission./////Our participation in the UNIFIL naval element remains part of our comprehensive engagement for Lebanon and the region, which includes political, economic and societal measures. This is because-and here too we should not delude ourselves-if we fail to reduce tensions in the region as a whole, to achieve progress in the Middle East peace process, to get results from the proximity talks which have fortunately begun and have not ended in spite of recent events due to President Abbas's wise decision, to turn indirect into direct talks, the international community's efforts will not produce the progress we all want-in the interests of the region, of Israel, and expressly also of an independent Palestinian state, as well as of Europe./////This is what it is about, and for that reason we ask you for this mandate. As we all know, everything is closely linked. We are asking you to approve what is a qualitatively and quantitatively new mandate./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1

Beyond the walls of this room, however, the fact that many economies in Africa are growing just as fast as in Asia is often still overlooked, as is the fact that an increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location, that a new middle class is gradually emerging there. There is good reason why countries such as China are now more present than ever in Africa./////Despite all the challenges, what I see above all when I look at Africa today are major opportunities and untapped potential-economic and political./////African political leaders are taking the continent's fate ever more into their own hands. Regional cooperation is on the rise. The clout of African regional organizations is growing. The principle of ownership is impacting behaviour./////We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper./////We cannot solve the world's most pressing problems without our neighbouring continent Africa./////We need a common response to climate change and its consequences, to development and food security issues, and to the challenges posed by rapidly growing or aging populations./////The time has come for a new turn towards partnership in our Africa policy. Away from a donor-recipient outlook. Towards a global responsibility partnership on equal footing./////The German Government will soon present a comprehensive concept for Africa, which takes into account Africa's changed self-perception as well as our own interests./////We see many young faces in the crowd gathered here today. These are the faces of the graduates of the Federal Foreign Office's first Training for International Diplomats course for French-speaking diplomats from Africa. We bid all of you a heartfelt welcome!/////It is up to your generation to create the new image of Africa and to shape future ties between Germany and Africa. Work with us for peace and development, live out our shared values. We can make freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights into a reality-in Africa, in Europe, and around the world./////Protecting human rights is an inextricable part of the connection between Europe and Africa. Human rights are the indispensable basis on which Europe and Africa can jointly help shape globalization./////Political rights are equal in importance to social and economic rights. For many years Germany has been calling for the United Nations to recognize the right to water as a human right. It is a great success that the General Assembly joined us in this position in July, and the Human Rights Council last week./////Germany has constantly worked to gain a greater say at the United Nations for the countries of the southern hemisphere./////The world is changing-the geopolitical balance is shifting eastward and southward. Africa is a part of these changes./////This holds especially true of peace and security. A Security Council without a strong African presence no longer reflects the current political reality./////We want to reform the Security Council to ensure that Africa is represented among the permanent members./////Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany. There can be no development without peace and security, as evidenced by the conflicts in Côte d'Ivoire, in the Sudan, in Somalia, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo./////That's why Germany promotes the multilateral approaches of the United Nations, the European Union and the G8, which aim for a viable African security architecture./////African security structures must grow stronger so that African solutions to African problems can be found. This is what the African Union expects of itself, an expectation which we strongly support./////The Economic Community of West African States has likewise raised its political profile beyond its original economic orientation. Progress in peace and security is all the more precious at a time when resources are scarce in the countries of West Africa. The trend in the region in recent years has been positive. The tireless work of ECOWAS has borne fruit./////I am extraordinarily pleased that Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas has received this year's German Africa Award./////Dr Chambas, your farsightedness, your courage, your political instincts and your tireless work on behalf of peace and freedom, development and reconciliation have achieved great things in West Africa./////Long before you joined ECOWAS, your reputation as a prudent mediator and conciliator preceded you./////Peaceful settlements in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in Côte d'Ivoire, in Guinea-Bissau and in Togo all bear your mark./////Under your leadership ECOWAS has also worked on solutions to the recent conflicts in Guinea and Niger. We shall miss you very much after your departure from ECOWAS. But I am confident that in other areas you will continue to act with every bit as much determination for the realization of your vision of democracy and the rule of law in West Africa./////It is above all thanks to you that democracy and the rule of law, good governance and human rights are now shared values of all ECOWAS member states./////Security and economic development can succeed only through regional cooperation. This principle has proved its worth in Europe and it is proving its worth in Africa too./////I thank you for your tireless work and unwavering commitment.//////////",0.1
Peace in the Middle East,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
Peace in the Middle East,    07.09.2010 - Speech,Opening speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the Business Forum at the 2010 Ambassadors Conference in Berlin on 7 September 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advance text __//////////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I am absolutely delighted to be able to welcome so many of you here to the Weltsaal at the Federal Foreign Office. I have been told that interest in the Business Forum at the Ambassadors Conference has never been as great as this year. This I find very gratifying, as it suggests you are optimistic about our country's opportunities and about its economic development./////I should like to extend a very warm welcome to the President of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services, Mr Anton Borner. Thank you very much for agreeing to address our Business Forum./////I would also like to welcome the top man at the Federal Economics Ministry, Federal Economics Minister Rainer Brderle, acting for the first time as something of a joint host at this event with us at the Federal Foreign Office. This is the first time that we, in our capacities as Economics Minister and Foreign Minister, have opened this Business Forum together. And I am delighted, Rainer, that you will be speaking to our many guests here today./////That, too, is undoubtedly an expression of cooperation. Allow me to welcome our many guests of honour, particularly of course the representatives of the parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag. A warm welcome to all the dignitaries. Protocol would require that they should all be welcomed personally, but in the interest of keeping things short, I will mention just one of their number. It is a privilege to welcome former Federal Economics Minister Professor Helmut Haussmann here today./////This Business Forum is taking place at a time when the German economy is very clearly recovering, catching up, regaining its old strength. After all, Germany's strength in the world primarily depends not on our military capability or the strength of our forces, although these are all important. No, it is Germany's economic strength which is the key to our influence and possibilities in the world. Germany's strength and international image depend not on military capacities, but first and foremost on diplomatic skill, on responsibility and humanity, and on our economic power. Together, these make up our political and moral authority in the world. And that is why I am particularly keen for foreign policy, too, to play its part in ensuring our country's economic success. When German foreign policy says it wants to promote economic opportunities for German businesses in the world, it may at first seem rather suspect to many people. In other countries, ambassadors and politicians, and even foreign ministers, would be criticized if they did not help their own economy to be successful. But in our case, sometimes, things go in precisely the opposite direction. And to my mind it is important to overcome this. Just as our close friends, our European neighbours, regard it as obvious that politics should open doors in the world for the country's own companies, the same must become obvious in Germany. And some of these debates we are having-and here I don't only mean the debates of recent weeks, but those of recent months as well-about whether politics is the business world's lackey when it tries to improve business opportunities-would be absolutely inconceivable in other countries in Europe no less sovereign or democratic than we are, no less structured and oriented to the rule of law./////Quite simply, the reality is that things in the world are shifting. We are living in a time of upheaval. A time of global upheaval. Things we are concerned with here in Germany, demographic development for instance, have to be discussed beyond the boundaries of national issues at global level: demographic development, i.e. changing age structures in society in Germany, in Europe, in comparison with other young continents. After all, this demographic development is not merely a challenge for us, for our national social security systems. It is also a challenge for foreign policy, because it is just a question of time until the young societies, those booming, dynamic societies which twenty years ago were shrugged off as developing countries, having become major emerging nations, also demand to be political, cultural and intellectual centres. These countries, these regions, won't be content just to sell us resources and have us sell them products. Rather, they will want a say in ""big politics"". That is why, although the G8 is certainly an important format, we are all aware that the G20 is becoming more and more important as a format for shaping globalization. Countries which, twenty years ago, or in my student days, really were still developing countries are now joining us as equal partners at international level at the round table or negotiating table. And not just when it comes to the area for which Rainer Brderle is responsible, namely economic policy, but also, of course, when it comes to the Middle East or crisis regions, or global issues. A country like Turkey, for example, regards its tremendous economic development as entitling it to have a say on other issues. That's what we're experiencing just now, not least in discussions on strategic orientation in Turkey. A country like Brazil, for example, with its amazing success story of recent years, not only claims the right to speak with us on economic issues, most recently at the German-Brazilian Economic Forum in Munich, but also, when President Lula or soon his successor appears on the world stage, then with the authority of his own economy, his own society. He goes to the Middle East, for instance, and tries to make his mark on the peace process./////Brazil, Argentina, China-all these upcoming countries are, of course, to a certain extent new competitors for us. But first and foremost they embody huge opportunities. They are markets for German products. And we are working hard to make these countries Germany's partners when it comes to peace, security and prosperity in the world too./////As an export nation, Germany needs to keep a very close eye on developments in the world. And I'm quite sure that Rainer Brderle, as Economics Minister and as one who has many years-actually, ungallant as it may be to say it-decades of experience in international politics, will be saying something about the markets, about the possibilities for cooperation. But what I am also concerned with is partnership that goes beyond economic considerations, partnership which emerges from positive economic development to bring stability, prosperity and peace./////With its 229 missions abroad, the Foreign Service is a true global network. And all the heads of mission you might talk to here today also have a dense network of contacts in their host country. They know who to talk to and can help open doors./////This may not be very important for a huge, globally operating company with tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of staff. Big companies like that are able to establish their own representations to conquer markets all around the world. But the many small and medium-sized enterprises are highly dependent on finding open doors at the chambers of commerce abroad, but also at our diplomatic missions, so that our diplomatic missions can in turn open other doors for them. These smaller companies are not in a position to keep up a dense network of representatives and offices around the world. That is why a sensible external economic affairs policy is predominantly in the interest of SMEs. And, incidentally, in the interest of their workers and the jobs they create./////The environmentfor exports and investments abroad certainly hasn't got any easier. In fact, in some countries it has become much more complicated./////German companies and German products are highly regarded abroad. ""Made in Germany"" was once intended as a taint on German products. But for a long time now ""Made in Germany"" has been a sign of the quality of German firms. What's behind ""Made in Germany""? What do people think of when they read that? Firstly, quality and reliability. And this reputation for reliability which German products rightly have is one which German politics needs to have abroad too, because the two go together. This is our excellent calling card./////So the economic sphere presents a great opportunity for our country, and expressly also for foreign policy. Foreign policy is globalization policy. I don't simply mean globalization of markets; I am calling for a comprehensive interpretation of globalization. It is also a matter of the globalization of values./////When we talk about globalization in Germany, we occasionally let fall the disparaging word ""globalism"". A real process is turned into an ""ism"", an ideology. As if we could just close our eyes and the rest of the world would immediately show consideration to Germany and Central Europe. You all know that this is not the case. Indeed, everyone in this country feels that this is not the case. But somehow we haven't yet really taken it on board. Globalization isn't just about trade, the exchange of goods, economic relations; no, globalization is also about the spread of values, of the rule of law. And the businesspeople gathered here today know full well that the rule of law is not just a human rights or civil rights goal which stirs our hearts; rather, it is of course also a question of reliability. Countries which cannot give their own citizens rule of law structures will not be regarded as reliable sites for investment. There is a connection here too. This is not the primacy of economics in human and civil rights, but rather it is the idea that countries with a rule of law deficit have to have it made clear to them: it is right for you, for your development, to embrace the rule of law and to completely accept and practise human rights./////Of course it is also a matter of modern infrastructure in developing and emerging economies, or of easier access to water and electricity. But this is not merely an act of humanity. Nor is it merely altruism, solidarity between individuals, solidarity between nations and countries; rather it is also a chance to get orders for German companies in the energy or infrastructure sector. Having visited many countries in my first few months in office, I can tell you that Germany has an extremely good reputation./////Development and prosperity in turn lead to stability, security and peace in the world. Economic development stabilizes societies. Increasing prosperity, particularly in poorer countries, stabilizes societies and inclines them more to peace. Wherever people have no chance to make anything of their lives, wherever people are in despair, they are naturally vulnerable to extremism and then also fundamentalism and terrorism. This is one of the reasons why we at the Federal Foreign Office put so much effort into handling crisis regions. It is not just because it is, in a way, a debt to humanity, but also because it is in our own interest to bear in mind the link between stabilization and economic and social opportunities in these countries, and thus also a peaceful world./////Latin America is one of Germany's partner regions. Four weeks ago, the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America Strategy. We want to raise our relations with the continent to a new qualitative level. Latin America is the key focus of this year's Ambassadors Conference. We share common values with many countries in the region. This is the solid foundation for increased cooperation. Germany should participate in the mood of change and the amazing dynamism to be seen on the continent. The opportunities and potential of enhanced cooperation with Latin America are far from exhausted. I propose an annual meeting of businesspeople and diplomats along the lines of the annual conference of the Asia-Pacific Committee, where we can develop concrete initiatives for increased cooperation with Latin America. We are ready to do this./////We are thinking beyond large-scale natural resources. We know, for example, that a country like Brazil is hugely committed to renewable energies. Here we can contribute German cutting-edge technologies. These are important cooperation projects from which everyone, but especially our partners, will benefit./////Over the next few months and years, I predict, Latin America will come more and more to the fore. The world will be looking to Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. And we saw ourselves with our ""summer fairytale"" just how a major sporting event like that can change a country's image. Suddenly the world realized that we Germans can be cheerful and uninhibited (though we always knew it of ourselves), and that Germany can have good weather (though we know, of course, that that's always the case). Overnight, Germany's image in the world changed completely, as many of you experienced. The same thing happened this summer with South Africa. Think back to everything the esteemed observers and critics wrote before the World Cup; they implied that a World Cup tournament in South Africa was bound to end in crime and murder, that the South Africans were incapable of organizing such an event. But South Africa was a wonderful host and changed the world's view both of that country and of the entire African continent, as I heard recently from Africans themselves at the African Union summit. Major events like these are guaranteed to affect us here: not just because of the sport, but also because they present huge opportunities, for investment for example-from the construction of stadiums to tourism marketing./////At global level German foreign policy is committed to fair framework conditions. We need global institutions which are universally accepted and capable of action. This is true of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as the World Trade Organization. We are approaching the necessary reforms resolutely. On international trade policy in particular, we must throw our entire weight onto the scale to ward off dangers to the world economy from a renewed bout of protectionism. Only free and open markets lead to development and growth. It is very gratifying that the Federal Economics Minister has put this right at the top of his agenda./////I am saying this not least with an eye to a country which is rightly taking up all our attention just now. As we are all aware, the floods in Pakistan in recent weeks have caused unimaginable damage and suffering. We Germans acted quickly to provide effective aid. When I say ""we Germans"", I mean not only the Government and state institutions, but also our citizens, something which is never highly enough appreciated. It means a great deal for our image in the world when our citizens respond so actively and so caringly in such situations. But what happens afterwards? After this immediate humanitarian aid, it is a question of what we can do for a country like Pakistan so that it remains stable, so that it doesn't crumple, collapse in economic terms. Here, again, foreign policy and economic policy need to work together, for example in an initiative I have just launched in Europe to open up channels for trade for products from Pakistan. A not uncontroversial move, as you all know, but presumably more sustainable than the help needed now in the short term but which naturally cannot be viable in the long term./////In this connection the Federal Economics Ministry and the Federal Foreign Office are pulling in the same direction. Rainer Brderle and I have been in complete agreement on this for many years. You'll have realized that we didn't just meet each other for the first time in the Cabinet./////We want to make use of new opportunities for Germany across the world. But we will not be losing sight of our partners right here on our doorstep. And this brings me to the last thought I'd like to share./////Of course we export a lot to East Asian countries and everyone is talking about China and the domestic changes it will have to undergo so that it can be even more important and attractive for us in economic terms. But-and maybe I'll surprise some of you now-Germany still exports more to the Netherlands than it does to China. So I'll just say one thing: we must value Europe. Not merely in economic terms, but especially as the major project for peace, freedom and prosperity on our continent. I say this because Europe is very often spoken of carelessly: Rainer Brderle, other colleagues and I could all tell tales about that. Of course it is unbelievably tiring sometimes to discuss things for hours, sometimes through the night, and to negotiate with countries where you wonder why they're vetoing things and what their interest could be in doing so. Of course it is strenuous to negotiate through the night, but the fact that the European cooperative model replaced the confrontation model that previously existed on our continent is a tremendous historic achievement by those who held positions of responsibility before us. It's better to negotiate through the night than to be at odds with countries on your own continent. Just over ten years ago we still had wars in Europe. Even if Europe had achieved nothing more than several decades of peace on our continent, it would still have been worthwhile./////This, to my mind, is more important than the issue of a single market with almost five hundred million people and the opportunities inherent in the single currency. But I would also say that European integration, the single market and single currency were success stories for Germany in particular, and especially for the German economy. That is why we must work together to promote this European ideal. Europe will only be strong if it is firmly supported by the people of Europe-and ensuring that this is the case is not a matter for policymakers alone./////Reliability must be the trademark of European economic and financial policy too. This means rigorous rules for swift debt reduction and on new borrowing. And these rules must actually be enforced. Anyone who ignores the joint responsibility, persists in reporting false figures, manipulates statistics, becomes overindebted, does not budget in a sound, serious manner, cannot simply get away with it in Europe. This applies to both small and large countries. This applies to others and also to us. The Stability and Growth Pact needs an automatic sanctions regime so that whenever anyone violates the joint responsibility it will have immediate consequences. I am firmly convinced of this and negotiations must take place on this now. It is in the interests of all euro states committed to a healthy euro, and anyone not sticking to the rules must not be allowed to get any more money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to all, no matter how big or powerful a country might be in Europe. We want a European Union of responsibility and we are enthusiastic Europeans, but what we don't want is a transfer union in Europe where basically everyone can behave irresponsibly without repercussions. That is not on. Anyone wishing to protect Europe will have to change the rules on this./////You all know that foreign and domestic policy are becoming ever more closely interlinked. You see this in the climate debate and also, for instance, in what we discussed yesterday with the Foreign Minister of Mexico./////I am delighted at and congratulate the Federal Economics Minister on the successful negotiations on energy policy and of course on the fact that a rational energy mix has been agreed. This is also of great significance for foreign policy, and here I come to the close. It is of course true that we discuss energy policy from the point of view of environmental protection and climate change, subjects we will shortly be considering in Cancun in Mexico. But energy policy is more than just a question of ecology, economics or the affordability of energy; rather, it is also a question of our foreign-policy sovereignty. If we make ourselves too dependent on one energy supplier, we are making ourselves not only economically dependent but also politically impressionable. And that is something we must always bear in mind. If we want to retain our sovereignty in foreign policy, then we have to acknowledge that our economy is best based on an energy mix. Hence the decisions of yesterday and the day before. I believe this to be right; energy policy, more than virtually any other field, shows just how interlinked foreign policy and economic policy really are./////Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to hearing what the Federal Economics Minister has to say to us.//////////",0.1
Peace in the Middle East,    09.04.2010 - Speech,Speech by Guido Westerwelle at a dinner hosted by the Southern African German Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text__/////Mr Boddenberg,/////Mr Moller,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Thank you very much for welcoming me here today and for your kind introductory words./////On behalf of the entire delegation, I thank you most warmly for inviting us to this beautiful Club. Please also accept belated Easter greetings from Berlin./////This year is arguably the most important year for South Africa since apartheid was finally vanquished in 1994. President Jacob Zuma himself said as much only a few weeks ago./////I believe that 2010 is a crucial year not only for South Africa, but for us all-a year in which we set the course for the future./////We have just had to face the toughest economic and financial crisis-the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression of 1929./////We are still left struggling with the consequences-in Africa, Europe, all over the world./////The public finances of nearly all OECD countries have found themselves in troubled waters, and here in Africa the crisis has made a deep dent in the most consistent economic upturn in the continent's history./////I can well imagine that you of all people, as representatives of private business, must be feeling the pinch and would have your own stories to tell./////However, I can also say that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We can feel it in Germany, in the EU, but here in Africa too./////A few days ago at an economic forum in Nairobi, the IMF Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stressed that the year 2010 would see a return to growth in Africa too. ""Africa is back"" is how he put it./////""Africa is back""-at first this may seem a rather strange notion to many observers in Germany and Europe. We perceive the African continent all too often as a continent of conflicts, crises and catastrophes./////However, I know not only from my discussions in the United Republic of Tanzania and today in Pretoria, but also from early trips, that nothing could be more false than this negative image of Africa. Sometimes, I admit, one has to dig a little deeper to see the potential and unearth new opportunities./////However, if we take the trouble, there is no limit to what we can discover and achieve. Germany and South Africa-Europe and its neighbouring continent-have a wealth of values, interests and goals in common./////Let me give you a brief outline of three areas of cooperation that I consider to be of crucial importance for this year, but also well beyond 2010./////First, we need to come together both to address the most pressing challenges in security policy and draw attention to global issues./////South Africa is our strategic partner in Africa, which is especially true with regard to our efforts to build peace and security on the continent./////We are together promoting the development of rule-of-law structures in southern Sudan by means of a trilateral training programme for Sudanese judges and public prosecutors. Particularly in this critical phase for the Sudan, in which landmark decisions are to be made regarding the country's future, we must not slacken our efforts to establish a minimum rule-of-law standard. Without peace and stability in the Sudan the development of the entire region is threatened./////Particularly when it comes to solving the crisis in Zimbabwe, South Africa is the key player and President Zuma is continually engaged personally in this process. Together we must play our part in ensuring that the intended power-sharing between the various political groups succeeds. We want a government in Zimbabwe that includes all political forces-a government that is not based on fear, intimidation and persecution but that respects human rights and the principles of the rule of law./////Germany and South Africa are also working closely together on developing a pan-African security architecture. South Africa is the driving force behind both the regional association SADC and the African Union./////Here Germany stands firmly by South Africa's side-supporting, for instance, the African Union in developing a Peace Support Operations Centre in Addis Ababa and training Somali police officers in Ethiopia./////South Africa is also our strategic partner on the continent when it comes to major global issues. South Africa is a partner in the G20, where we consult closely on the most important issues relating to the international financial and economic system. We are also working together within the framework of international climate negotiations for an ambitious follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol./////I am especially delighted that, in nominating Minister of Tourism-formerly Minister for Environmental Affairs and Tourism-Marthinus van Schalkwyk, South Africa has proposed an outstanding candidate to lead the UN Climate Change Secretariat in my home town Bonn./////Let me turn now to another area of cooperation that is crucial for Germany and South Africa: economic development and economic cooperation./////South Africa is by far Germany's most important economic partner in Africa: worldwide South Africa ranks seventh place among Germany's non-European trading partners. At the same time Germany is South Africa's second most important trading partner worldwide./////There are currently around 600 German companies in South Africa and together they have created a total of 90,000 jobs. The main focuses of German enterprise are car manufacture, chemicals, and mechanical and electrical engineering./////Why do I make a point of stating this? I do this because, particularly as a politician and Foreign Minister of liberal persuasion, I am firmly convinced that economic links, investment, trade and entrepreneurship are crucial for jobs, growth and prosperity./////However, economic exchange is also indeed crucial to the peaceful coexistence of peoples and nations-and thus in our best national and European interests./////This applies even more in the age of globalization, where we can use our economic links to bring about a globalization of values as well. In this way globalization becomes a win-win situation for both sides, and not just economically./////As I see it, external economic promotion is therefore a key element in any foreign policy with an eye to the future. This applies even more to a country like Germany, where so much importance is attached to exports and to economic links as a whole./////Here I would like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution. I cannot praise highly enough the work of the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad: a total of 120 spread across 80 different countries. Not only do they open doors: they also build bridges./////They are ambassadors for our country and our economy. I especially welcome your commit­ment with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility. Social responsibility is not an alien concept to German businesses, at home or abroad; rather, it is part and parcel of a modern business philosophy that is in keeping with the times. This is the globalization of values in action./////I strongly encourage you to continue along this path. I'm sure your efforts will shine through, both in the quality of your products and, ultimately, in your balance sheets./////I also speak for my colleague Dirk Niebel, who is accompanying me on this Africa tour, when I say this. By the way, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first major trip to Africa in almost twenty years by a Federal Foreign Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development./////There is no place for institutional rivalry in the tasks that lie ahead. On the contrary, what we require is a seamless policy on Africa. This will also find its expression in the Federal Government's strategy for Africa, which we are working on together./////This is especially true in the case of a partner country like South Africa, which has long since outgrown the classic label of developing country and is itself now a development aid provider./////This makes it all the more important that we reach agreement on specific areas where we share a common interest, for instance on energy and climate policy, climate technology, or vocational training. The intergovernmental negotiations which ended today, that focused on defining the priorities for our future work, set a most encouraging tone for our continuing cooperation in areas of relevance to the years to come./////Finally, I would like to address a third area of cooperation that is especially close to my heart and relevant here to our policy on Africa: cultural relations and education policy./////We live in the age of globalization. This is not an aspect we can choose to switch on or off at our convenience, but a fact of life that we have to come to terms with, for better or worse./////I believe globalization brings with it immense opportunities. Politically and economically, but also culturally. Where distances shrivel to nothing and communication knows no limits, there the principles of cultural understanding can flourish-the principles by which we learn not only from one another but in each other's best interests./////This is precisely the approach we need: active promotion of the German language, particu­larly in Africa; strengthening the Goethe-Institut; cooperating in education, science and sport. Having just visited the science park and innovation centre, I have been deeply impressed by how much South Africa in particular is investing in research and innovation, in the develop­ment of high-tech solutions./////Knowledge is the key resource of the 21st century. Education is the social issue of the age of globalization./////This is as true for Europe as it is for Africa. Enhanced cooperation in the fields of education, research and innovation is therefore exactly the right way to capitalize together on the oppor­tunities that globalization affords-and this applies to South Africa just as much as it does to Germany./////Africa is on the ascent. The continent's population is young, motivated and hungry for education./////A few weeks ago, the American publication Newsweek was talking about the possibility of Africa becoming the new Asia./////With its increasing buying power, a new middle class is emerging that is bolstering domestic demand. A middle class whose motivation and zeal ensure that more and more international companies are discovering Africa as a location for investment. And finally, a middle class that wants political participation and upholds the values of democracy and the rule of law./////We want to strengthen these positive forces on the African continent: we want to support Africa in its ascent-with policies that favour partnership in the pursuit of peace and stability, in the pursuit of economic development and cultural understanding./////It is 62 days to kick-off. South Africa is to host this year's FIFA World Cup. The enthusiasm is already palpable. I am certain that this first FIFA World Cup on African soil will be a mega event-a unique opportunity for the country, indeed for the whole continent./////Let us use this mood of optimism to promote a new image of the African continent-one that moves far beyond the old doom and gloom or an all too naive African romanticism./////We need a realistic image of Africa, one that recognizes the opportunities as well as the challenges that lie ahead. If we can succeed in this, then together we can reach the right decisions, so that 2010 becomes not just the ""first post-crisis year"", but a year when we all make the ascent together./////Thank you very much./////",0.1
Peace in the Middle East,    14.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on 14 November 2010 in Berlin at the main Day of National Mourning ceremony - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __///////////////Federal President,Mrs Wulff,President of the Bundesrat,President of the Bundestag,President of the Federal Constitutional Court,President of the German War Graves Commission,Colleagues,Nuncio,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,//////////Today, the Day of National Mourning, we remember all those who lost their lives through war, terror, violence and tyranny./////Today we remember those who were persecuted, mistreated and murdered because of their beliefs, religion, race, sexual orientation or simply because they were who they were./////We know how tenaciously war and violence continue to blight lives. Wars cast long shadows. Also on generations who did not experience them at first hand./////War, violence, persecution-these are not just scourges of the twentieth century. This still young twenty-first century has already seen a multitude of conflicts that have brought suffering and death to millions. Our world is not a peaceful place./////Every day we see reports and images of human tragedies that have claimed lives. We know how powerful these images are-and we know what they convey is also powerlessness. Let us never forget that every victim has a personal story. Every victim is sorely missed./////The German War Graves Commission looks after the sites where so many have found their last resting place. Through this work it gives the dead back their dignity, and the living a place to mourn and meet others who have suffered similar loss./////The German War Graves Commission carries out its valuable work at the behest of the German Government. So let me express heartfelt thanks, Mr Fhrer, to you and all the Commission's staff as well as to the whole organization./////The Commission is assisted in its activities by thousands of ordinary citizens who give generously of their time and energy. Over one million supporters and donors help ensure the organization can fulfil its important mission. This broad support in all sections of society testifies to the great respect people feel for the Commission's work. And it also highlights the importance they attach to ensuring the dead are remembered in a fitting way./////With the Iron Curtain gone, the War Graves Commission could also extend its activities to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In recent years this has led to the creation of several new German war cemeteries in Russia, most recently in Kursk and Smolensk, as well as in Belarus and Ukraine. Even 65 years after the end of World War II, however, the Commission's work is still far from over./////Just a few weeks ago another German war cemetery was consecrated in Cheb, the culmination of years of hard work. Around 5000 war dead have been laid to rest there./////The discovery of a mass grave in Slovenia containing the mortal remains of thousands killed at the end of World War II was confirmed only this week./////Through establishing and looking after over 800 war cemeteries containing almost 2 million war dead in 45 different countries, the German War Graves Commission has created not only sites of remembrance but also places where people can learn about the past. With its motto ""Reconciliation above the graves-work for peace"", the Commission aptly sums up its agenda and underlines the political significance of its work./////Federal President Theodor Heuss delivered the first speech marking the Day of National Mourning in the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany. In this speech he cited a soldier with whom he had previously discussed his thoughts on the subject. ""Don't forget,"" the soldier told him, ""that the feelings of the German mothers and wives are the feelings of the British, French, Italian, American and Russian mothers and wives as well."" The suffering of millions of families both on the side of the defeated and liberated and on the side of the victors and liberators became a common bond dedicated to reconciliation and peace that still remains strong today./////Where enmity and mistrust had long shaped perceptions on both sides, new trust could start to grow./////Trust is a most precious thing. Both between countries and between people. Trust needs time to grow and is quickly destroyed. Trust needs a solid basis. Credibility and reliability can provide that solid basis. However, trust goes beyond what there are good reasons for-it ventures into new and unknown realms. Therein lies its strength./////Sixty-five years ago no one trusted the Germans. Germany had excluded itself from the community of nations. It was in this context that the fathers and mothers of our Basic Law clearly defined in its preamble the fundamental goal of Germany policy: ""to promote world peace in a united Europe"". With this compass as our guide, over the decades we gradually built the trust without which the achievement of German unity 20 years ago would never have happened. Our country continues to steer by this compass to this day./////Germany was elected to the United Nations Security Council just a few days after we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Day of German Unity. Both events had something to do with the trust the world now has in Germany./////The great achievement of the post-war generations was to seek reconciliation with our neighbours. Here also the work of the German War Graves Commission played its part./////Today in our relations with Poland we are well on the way to forging the same kind of close ties that Germans and French people developed over the decades. Europe is growing together and we want to complete this process also with our neighbours to the East. Achieving full reconciliation with Poland we see as our historic mission./////The European Union is the starting-point for Germany's whole foreign policy. Europe means greater freedom, greater security and greater prosperity for everyone. But even more important, European integration has, right from the start, been a unique project for peace. The old paradigm of confrontation in Europe has given way to a new paradigm of cooperation and integration./////While we may complain about Europe at times, we must never forget what we owe to Europe. If Europe had given us no more than decades of peace on our continent, it would still have been worth it./////I am rather concerned right now about Europe. I can only warn against any trend towards renationalization directed against Europe. Those who responded to the euro crisis this spring by calling the whole European idea into question have learned nothing from history. Cooperation can be tough going. But anyone familiar with the consequences of confrontation, anyone familiar with European history knows that cooperation is worth every ounce of effort./////The secret of the success of European integration is the table in Brussels, around which all EU countries sit as equal partners with the same rights, whatever their size. The Union is not divided into important and unimportant countries. We have only been able to overcome centuries of confrontation by cooperating and treating each other as equals./////As individuals, we all owe each other respect. As countries, too, we all owe each other respect./////That goes for Europe and for the whole world as well./////In many parts of the world today peace, freedom and human rights are under threat. Germany is living up to its international responsibilities. This is incumbent on us also in the light of our history. In the so-called Third Reich what was lost first was respect for the human rights of some and then the freedom of everyone in Germany and finally peace in Europe and the whole world./////Today, however, Germany's commitment to peace, freedom and human rights is universally recognized. We are participating in several peace missions. All with a clearcut mandate from the United Nations. We see the use of military force only as a last resort. Where military force is concerned, Germany remains committed to a culture of restraint./////As is clear from our engagement in Afghanistan, working for peace and human rights can be a dangerous business. Forty-four of our fellow citizens have been killed while serving there. Today we pay tribute also to them. We feel deeply for their families./////Our thoughts are also with those who, in the interest of us all, are doing important work far from home: our soldiers, police officers, development workers, NGO staff and diplomats. We are grateful to them all. And we are proud of what they are doing./////Our country does not look the other way when human lives are at risk. Germany is helping to bring security to people whose lives are in danger. We are helping to bring freedom to people who still today know only the opposite./////We are doing our share in Yemen, in Somalia and also in the Middle East. Last week I returned from my third visit to the Middle East. We should not delude ourselves that we hold the key to a peaceful solution there. But we want to do all we can to foster and strengthen the fragile process towards a two-state solution./////Our dogged attempts to settle conflicts peacefully should not be mistaken for a lack of realism. There is only a limited amount we can do to stabilize failed or failing states. The real key to ending violence is a yearning for peace among people on the ground and a desire for reconciliation./////Here in Europe in the second half of the twentieth century a new chapter was finally opened, a chapter dedicated to overcoming hatred and promoting reconciliation. That is why it is incumbent on Europeans especially, and us Germans in particular, to strive for mutual understanding and reconciliation throughout the world and thereby help make it a more peaceful place./////Political action encompasses far more than what government does. The dead teach us that the community has a responsibility for each and every individual. They also teach that every individual has a responsibility for the community in which they live. Humanity and compassion are values that make no distinction on the basis of colour or belief. These are the values that must inform the way we live together in Germany and the way Germany acts in the wider world./////The Day of National Mourning enjoins us to recognize the value of human life and the inalienable dignity of every human being for what they are-the most precious thing there is./////",0.1
Afghanistan situation,    16.12.2010 - Speech,Policy statement by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle: Progress and challenges in Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ,International Conference,"/////Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,/////When it took office a little over a year ago, this Government made a no-holds-barred analysis of its involvement in Afghanistan. The international community had already been engaged there for more than eight years. Its great efforts appeared to be leading nowhere, and there was no end in sight for its mission./////This Government has placed our engagement on a new footing with the comprehensive Afghanistan Policy. We have described the situation realistically. We have set ourselves realistic goals. Together with the Afghan people and our international partners, we have closely coordinated these goals, our strategy and the means to carry it out./////With the backing of this House, we have sent more soldiers and police officers to up the speed and quality of training for Afghan security forces. We have mobilized additional support for civilian reconstruction. We have been a driving force behind the political solution and smoothed the way for the reintegration and reconciliation programme. We have reformulated our own expectations, more soberly and more realistically. Good governance remains the ideal measure. Realistically speaking, however, what we can hope to achieve in Afghanistan in the foreseeable future is good enough governance./////We have said goodbye to the image of a development worker in uniform./////The image may in the past have made it easier for some Members of the Bundestag to approve sending the Bundeswehr to Afghanistan. Nonetheless, it was always deceptive. The situation on the ground is quite different. Our soldiers are in fact fighting in Afghanistan. This mission is costing lives. What we are doing in Afghanistan is defending our own security. That is what makes it right to carry out this mission. It is also right that it cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely./////We mourn the 44 German soldiers who have lost their lives on this mission. Our sympathy goes out to their families and friends. We mourn the many victims of the conflict, of all nationalities. We mourn those who died in uniform as well as the many civilians who have fallen in this conflict and in the struggle for peace./////I wish also to give mention to a man who made a crucial contribution to shaping the work done in Afghanistan. We mourn the loss of Richard Holbrooke. His sudden passing has taken from us a close and true friend of Germany./////In London in January, we paved the way for Afghans to shoulder greater responsibility. The Afghan Government for the first time provided a very specific outline of how it intended to achieve its goals in the areas of governance, institution-building and development, security as well as reintegration and reconciliation. For our part, we pledged to increase our efforts./////In Kabul in July, at the first Afghanistan Conference held in the country itself, the Afghan Government translated its political commitments into concrete reform projects. With the support of the international community, it has created the structures and institutions needed to achieve these ambitious goals./////In Lisbon four weeks ago, we took the next step and formally agreed with the Afghan Government and all our NATO partners to start the handover process. We will begin handing over responsibility for security in the provinces in the first half of 2011. Handing over responsibility in the first few provinces is not the same as immediately withdrawing our troops, but it will mark the beginning of the gradual reduction in the international military presence in Afghanistan, including the gradual withdrawal of the Bundeswehr. Thanks to the progress which has been made, withdrawal is now becoming a realistic prospect./////In my policy statement on 10 February, I said that we hoped to be far enough along by the end of 2011 that it would be possible to reduce our Bundeswehr contingent./////Today, I am confident enough to say that, at the end of 2011, we will be able to reduce our Bundeswehr contingent in Afghanistan for the first time. We will use all the room for manoeuvre available to ensure that we begin this reduction as early as possible given the situation on the ground and, above all, the need not to endanger the remaining troops. We want to hand over full responsibility to the Afghans in 2014. It is our intention that there will no longer be any German combat troops deployed in the Hindu Kush by then./////The timetable is set. The road to self-sustaining security in Afghanistan has been marked out. We are determined to take one step at a time and continually review what has been achieved. That is why this Government has for the first time presented a comprehensive progress report on Afghanistan to the German Bundestag. The report, which has been publicly available since Monday, describes the German and international engagement. It offers an honest and realistic depiction of the situation. It gives equal weight to the fields of security, governance and development. I am grateful to the Federal Ministers of Defence, of the Interior and for Economic Cooperation and Development for their outstanding cooperation in Afghanistan and on the drafting of this frank report. The report casts light on the work done in Afghanistan by our men and women in the Bundeswehr and police, by the many civilian aid workers and by our diplomats. It also outlines what still needs to be done to enable us to hand over to the Afghan Government the responsibility we currently have there./////We make no attempt to gloss anything over. There are still far too many reports of setbacks. Corruption exists, and there were irregularities in the elections. However, it is an encouraging sign that the people of Afghanistan themselves unrelentingly followed up cases of electoral fraud./////In many ways, Afghanistan has done better this year than last. Thanks in part to our development work in the health sector, 80 percent of the population now have access to basic healthcare. Maternal and infant mortality has gone down significantly. More than one in three girls in Afghanistan now regularly attend school. In 2010 alone, we built more than 20 schools./////We set up several stabilization funds this year for the development of infrastructure in the north. These have had a particular impact among the population in the regions bordering Tajikistan and Pakistan, in which infrastructure is weak. Newly constructed roads and bridges are underpinning the economic development which is slowly getting under way./////Progress in training soldiers and police officers has been more rapid than expected. The target agreed in London of around 300,000 security personnel in the army and police will be reached significantly sooner than planned. Germany is playing its part here: around 200 German police officers are serving in Afghanistan, where they are training the Afghan police force. In 2010, Germany made a total of 77 million euro available for police training./////It is true that the number of security incidents has once again risen significantly. One of the reasons for this is the increase in the International Security Assistance Force. However, after a year which has seen heavy fighting and many casualties, progress is also being made on security. This is thanks not only to ISAF troops but also to the increased capabilities of the Afghan security forces. It is clear that the increased training by the international community, including the Bundeswehr, is bearing fruit, with the Afghan army and the Afghan police force becoming recognizably more professional./////In 2010 we drew up the timetable for full sovereignty for Afghanistan; we have increased our funding and support and thus created the prerequisites for a turnabout. Next year, the aim will be to implement the strategy of networked security with its military, civilian and political elements so consistently that substantial progress can be made in all areas. The basis and prerequisite of such progress is the commitment of the Afghan Government. It is up to the Afghan Government to create the necessary structures and, in the end, take responsibility for living conditions for people in Afghanistan. It has proved not only in words but also by its actions how seriously it takes this duty./////The conflict in Afghanistan cannot be resolved by military means; only a political solution can bring it to an end. This means that talks need to be held with representatives of the insurgents. Together with the Afghans, we have defined three non-negotiable principles for these talks. A lot of things are open to negotiation, but these are not://///everyone must, firstly, respect the Afghan constitution and the human rights it guarantees;/////secondly, renounce violence;/////and, thirdly, sever their links to international terrorism./////In June this year, the Afghan Government's peace and reintegration programme was adopted at the National Consultative Peace Jirga. This High Peace Council is to provide the linchpin for the talks with insurgents which need to be held. We know that talks are taking place about possible mechanisms for cooperation. Because of the nature of the situation, this reconciliation process will take time and is more likely to be hindered than helped by too much publicity./////Reintegration is also essential, clearing a path back into Afghan society for anti-government fighters who are willing to take it. Those willing to lay down their arms must be given an opportunity to lead a normal life. In 2010, Germany contributed 10 million euro to the reintegration programme. Another 40 million euro have been pledged up until 2014. This is particularly important, as reintegration and reconciliation are interdependent and essential elements of the handover process./////At the beginning of next year, NATO and its Afghan partners will together examine each province in turn, applying agreed security criteria, to ensure that it is ready for handover; responsibility will then be placed in the hands of the Afghan security forces. It is certain that regions within Germany's sphere of responsibility in northern Afghanistan will be among the first in which responsibility for security is handed over to the Afghan people. The intention is to complete this process for the whole country by 2014. That is what we want. It is also what the Karzai Government wants. It is what the international community has agreed on./////What is also clear, however, is that transition does not mean ending our mission overnight and simply removing ourselves from Afghanistan./////As the handover of responsibility progresses, we will be constantly reappraising our priorities. The handover process must be careful, sustainable and above all irreversible. It would have no benefit if the Taliban were able to move back in the day after international troops withdraw-not for the people of Afghanistan and not for our own security./////What is clear is that we want to and will indeed continue to support Afghanistan's development in the long term. In Lisbon, the NATO partners declared their commitment to an enduring partnership with Afghanistan. Without the international community's credible commitment even after 2014, the strategy of a responsible handover of responsibility will not work./////Over the next two years, we will have a particular responsibility in the field of peace and security as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The mandate for international engagement in Afghanistan will be an important part of our work in New York. Our goal is to strengthen the role of the United Nations and its mission in Afghanistan long term. In seeking this end, we will rely not only on our traditional partners but also on other players, especially the key powers in the region. This formed part of my talks in India, and I will continue to pursue the issue when I visit Pakistan in January./////At the NATO Summit in Lisbon, President Karzai called on Germany to hold another international conference on Afghanistan in Bonn at the end of 2011, ten years after the first Bonn Conference. We understand this request as proof that Germany is seen in Afghanistan as a reliable and honest partner. This Government will fulfil that request in view of our fundamental interest in good development in Afghanistan and in the region as a whole./////Although it is too soon to plan the agenda in detail, what we can say is that this conference will be an opportunity one year on from Lisbon to evaluate the state of play in the handover process and map out the road that will take us to the end of 2014. We will also discuss how the international community should remain committed to the country in the long term, after 2014. We intend the Bonn Conference to provide an impetus which will support the political process in Afghanistan./////After years in which the international community's efforts in Afghanistan often lacked coordination, we now see everybody pulling in the same direction. We intend to do all that is necessary to ensure that Afghanistan, scarred and fragmented by decades of conflict in an explosive region of the world, will never again be a safe haven for terrorists./////We are working to bring peace, security and a degree of prosperity to a country which has in recent history known only war, instability and extreme poverty. Germany, as a responsible member of the global community and the transatlantic alliance, has been dedicated to this task from the outset. We therefore intend to ask this House again in January 2011 to extend the mandate for the Bundeswehr's deployment as part of ISAF./////I would like to turn to the brave men and women of the Bundeswehr, many of whose eyes are upon us at this time. Our thanks go out to you for your work. We are proud of what you are doing. For many of you, the pressures of your mission will not even be relieved by your return home, since you will still need to process so much of what you have seen. I think this House can let the men and women serving in Afghanistan know what pride we have in them./////More than 60 Members of this House as well as its President have visited Afghanistan this year./////Both Bundestag and Government support this mission. This year, five Federal Ministers went to the country, the Federal Minister of Defence alone visiting seven times./////[...]/////This high level of presence and frequency of visits are evidence of interest and sympathy. It provides support for our men and women in Afghanistan. That much is clear: on my visits, I see for myself again and again that our men and women in the Bundeswehr need and want that support./////An honest assessment of the situation today shows us a mixed picture of some light and still far too much shade. There are nonetheless grounds for confidence that we will be able to attain our objectives./////When we have done so, we will not only have increased our own, European and global security, but also given millions of Afghans the chance of a somewhat better life. Our responsibility for our own country and also for Afghanistan compels us to fulfil this task./////Thank you very much for your attention.//////////",0.2
Afghanistan situation,    21.01.2011 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle in the German Bundestag on the occasion of the first reading of the draft mandate for extending Germany's participation in ISAF in Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Mr President! Ladies and gentlemen!/////It is not by chance that today's debate on Afghanistan and the situation in the country began with a policy statement by Dirk Niebel, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. This clearly shows that we must give prominence not only to the military service that our men and women of the Bundeswehr are performing there. Since so many service members are present here today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you and to your comrades, on behalf of this House, for everything you are doing in Afghanistan./////Of course we also know-and the servicemen and women are especially aware of this-that we will not succeed in Afghanistan if we place all our faith in a military solution. Our military commitment serves to bolster stability in Afghanistan. The visible progress that has been made on civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan is highly remarkable. No other German Government has been engaged in civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan to the extent the current Government has. No other German Government has done as much for building up and training Afghan security forces as the current Government has. May I ask you to take this into account when criticizing us. The situation was different when you were in power./////However, civilian reconstruction and safeguarding these achievements with a view to the country's stability can of course only be part of the solution. The political solution is what matters most. This realization is at the heart of the shift in strategy that took place almost exactly one year ago at the London Conference on Afghanistan. At the time, this strategy shift was highly controversial, also in this House. But it is becoming clear that what the German Government negotiated in London together with its partners was right. We will not achieve peace in Afghanistan by military means, but only through a political solution. Our international engagement therefore aims to bring about a political solution, with a view to creating sustainable and lasting stability in Afghanistan-so that also once our engagement has ended, the country will not again become a safe haven and refuge for international terrorism./////It is key to this political process that all actors be involved. It is paramount that we are ever more successful in our efforts towards regional involvement, that is to say involving affected neighbouring countries. A start was made in London with the Conference on Afghanistan. Subsequently, for the first time, a conference on Afghanistan-attended by all actors-was held in Kabul, that is, in the country itself. Participants included, one should note, those neighbouring countries that have not taken part in the process for years. At this conference, agreements were also reached between Afghanistan and Pakistan. From a Central European vantage point, such trade agreements would appear easy to conclude. Yet anyone with background knowledge about relations between the two countries knows that these agreements represent a huge step forward. Regarding Iran, there are many questions-I am thinking, for example, of those relating to the drug trafficking-that can only be answered by involving neighbouring countries and through relevant networking. All of this happened./////Late last year, NATO held its summit in Lisbon. It was a true milestone. I would like to again mention the four dates-not just three-of our road map, of our strategy for the future://///First, during the first half of this year, we want to begin transferring responsibility for local security in the districts and provinces./////Second, we are confident that, by the end of the year, we will be able to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time./////Third, by the end of 2014 we should have succeeded in completely transferring responsibility for local security to the Afghans. This is not only our aim, it is also the express aim of the Afghan Government that there will no longer be any of our combat troops in the country./////The fourth point is often forgotten. Also beyond 2014, Germany must remain actively committed to sustainable security in Afghanistan. Were we not to do so, the Taliban would immediately regain the upper hand. They would again sow the seeds of terrorism throughout the world, and all efforts, also those of our Bundeswehr men and women, would have been in vain. We would be back to square one. There must be no second vacuum left behind in Afghanistan. This is what we believe is at stake./////In the policy statement I delivered in December 2010, I commented on this in detail. Contrary to everything that has been insinuated in this connection, it is totally clear that every road map is always contingent on the situation actually turning out as foreseen. By the way, this has not only been included in the text of the mandate for the first time, but is word for word what I said in my policy statement on behalf of the German Government in December./////In other words: by the end of 2011, we want to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time. Yet it is self-understood that, for all of this, the following conditions must be met: only if the situation permits, and only if our servicemen and women on the ground are not endangered. Because what we want is an irreversible and sustainable process of transfer of responsibility. This is the objective.///// (_)/////The German Government is confident that, as security responsibility is progressively handed over, the presence of Bundeswehr forces can be reduced, starting at the end of 2011. The German Government will use all of the leverage that is justifiable in terms of security policy to draw down forces as early as possible-if the situation permits, and provided that neither our service members nor the sustainability of the transition process are put at risk./////On this point, one does not have to be a military expert. Simple common sense will tell you this is the rational way forward. And that is what matters in the end./////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, our colleague Mr Omid Nouripour (The Greens) would like to ask you a question./////Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle://///Please, go ahead./////Omid Nouripour (Alliance 90/The Greens)://///Mr Minister, you have just said that, if possible and if the security situation permits, the presence of German servicemen and women in Afghanistan is to be reduced by the end of this year. I have the following question: Are you excluding the possibility that the mandate ceiling could in the meantime be raised due to the employment of AWACS planes, or that some of the flexible reserve personnel may be brought in?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///On this issue, I share the position of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and I suggest you take a close look at it./////Generally speaking, travelling seems to purify the mind-because SPD Chairman Sigmar Gabriel in an interview today said that these are two separate matters. Germany has declared that, for the time being, we are not participating in the AWACS operation, since we are focusing on basic and further training. Apart from this, we naturally discuss and reassess everything with our Allies at regular intervals. Therefore, the question of whether I would exclude anything may be useful for political bickering between parties, but it is totally inappropriate as regards substance-considering that, in an alliance, we can only succeed together. This question is totally inappropriate!/////I am telling you this, dear colleague, because I believe you really could learn a thing or two from the larger opposition party, the SPD./////These days, the Social Democratic Party is struggling to find a position, holding discussions, and weighing the arguments, and it has publicly stated in response to the Federal Government's request that it will not abandon our men and women in uniform, and that it wants to support them./////Your party is completely different. No foreign minister sent as many service members into missions abroad as The Greens' foreign minister-but your memory grew clouded as soon as you switched to the opposition./////What you are doing is irresponsible-I repeat, irresponsible!/////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, would you reply to a question by our colleague Mr Stefan Liebich (The Left)?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///Yes./////Stefan Liebich (The Left)://///Mr Foreign Minister, you have just read some passages from the text that we will be voting on, but not from the section that is up for vote. Can you confirm that the condition the SPD has made a prerequisite for its consent is not even met in the Federal Government's motion, and that what you have read here, along with every figure indicating a withdrawal, is merely mentioned in the explanatory part of the motion?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///I will give you a short reply-although you have been a member of the German Bundestag not for a few weeks, but for a few months already./////With all due respect, dear colleague, you should know that it is standard practice for us to submit a text, for which the explanatory part of course forms the political context. Are you seriously suggesting that the German Bundestag resolve that the German Government is confident? I think the German Bundestag should be more self-assured here. The armed forces operate under a parliamentary mandate, not a government one. That is why the German Bundestag has the final say. Anything else would be surreal./////It will then be our task to make every effort to move forward this year the process that we will hopefully unanimously, or at any rate by a large majority, agree in this House. Last year, three important milestones were set along the path towards the political solution we seek: London, Kabul, and the conference in Lisbon. This year will see another important milestone right here in Germany, namely the Conference on Afghanistan in Bonn. I predict that this conference, scheduled for the end of the year, will focus on the high-stake issues: a political solution, reintegration, including reconciliation, and dialogue. This Afghanistan conference must however also concentrate on the time following 2014. This was where I left off before the questions were asked./////Dear colleagues, anyone who now conveys the impression in Afghanistan that, as of 2014, people will be left in the lurch-because we don't care about them any longer, they can do what they want and should handle things on their own-he or she will only find that no progress will be made on good governance or on the fight against drug trafficking and corruption, or on democratic development, which is our common objective. We would thereby risk the partners we need for building up the country on a secure and permanent basis turning their backs on us-due to fear for their own, and their families', lives./////This would not be responsible policy; what we want is a responsible handover of responsibility. Something that has been jointly decided in the German Bundestag must be completed in a responsible way. And you must not disappoint the friends you need to enhance security also here in Germany, given the threat of terrorism./////As a member of the United Nations Security Council, we have taken on a coordinating role as regards Afghanistan. I will therefore address the German Bundestag on a regular basis on this topic. I assume that we will also hold regular discussions in the committees. I can assure you that I will keep you, that is your spokespeople and representatives, informed on progress whenever possible. You have probably noticed that I have done so in recent months, and this practice will be continued. In my opinion, a broad majority in the German Bundestag is not so much a political issue, but rather would stand for clear support for the men and women in the Bundeswehr, who are risking their lives in Afghanistan for our freedom and security./////Such a broad majority is also of importance for our international partners, and for our Allies-so they can rest assured that there is broad political support./////Politicians must be prepared to shoulder responsibility, even if this costs them some opinion poll percentage points./////What is most important is the security, freedom, and future of our country and of Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen of the opposition, and of The Greens: you should follow the example of the Social Democrats. These words coming from me should give you pause for thought./////Thank you./////",0.2
Afghanistan situation,    09.07.2010 - Speech,"Policy statement by Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle: ""Afghanistan and the Kabul Conference: paving the way for a responsible handover"" - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,/////the International Conference on Afghanistan is taking place in Kabul on 20 July. No doubt there would have been simpler places in the world in which to hold the conference. The fact that this foreign ministers' meeting is taking place in Kabul is a signal. The conference venue is an expression of our firm determination to transfer complete responsibility for security into Afghan hands. The venue is also an expression of the Afghans' strong desire to take their country's fate into their own hands once again./////The Kabul Conference is the first international conference on Afghanistan to be held in Afghanistan. This is more than symbolic. It shows that we have embarked on a new phase in the process which is the responsible handover of responsibility to the Afghan people./////Germany and over 40 other nations are engaged in Afghanistan under a United Nations mandate in order to prevent the country from once again becoming a haven for international terrorism. Our fellow Germans are serving in Afghanistan so that we can live in safety here. Germany's engagement in Afghanistan is not popular, but it remains necessary and in our own interest./////At the London Conference at the beginning of this year, the Afghan Government on the one hand and the international community on the other entered into a mutual obligation: the Afghan Government committed itself to aim for better governance, to seek to establish the rule of law, to fight corruption and to reduce drug cultivation. In turn, the international community undertook to step up its endeavours to help the Afghans achieve these goals./////The international community has kept its promise. The Federal Government presented its Afghanistan Policy Paper in January and set in motion its implementation./////I would like to thank the Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Dirk Niebel, for the fact that we have succeeded in almost doubling Germany's civilian assistance for the people of Afghanistan./////Since the beginning of the year we have also almost doubled the number of German police instructors on the ground. I expressly thank the Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière, and the federal states for this important contribution./////I thank the Federal Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, for his helpful cooperation on the new version of the German ISAF mandate to take account of our inter­national agreements. Together we further strengthened the focus of German participation, namely training for Afghan security forces. Alongside some restructuring of the mandate, we can today send 500 additional soldiers to Afghanistan to improve and speed up training for local security forces./////This week the Federal Cabinet passed the most ambitious austerity budget in the history of the Federal Republic. But no savings will be made on our commitment in Afghanistan. Germany keeps its promises./////Some things have been achieved since London://///We have built new training centres for the police and provided basic and further training for almost 2000 Afghan police officers this year./////We have started to rebuilt the provincial hospitals in Kunduz and Takhar. We are supporting mobile health teams in the north of the country which will bring healthcare to the people there. We hope to reach about 2.6 million people in this way./////In Balkh province we have created new school places for 3000 boys and girls. And at our new teacher training centre in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, more than 6000 people are undergoing teacher training./////All this in the past six months./////However, making an honest appraisal also means not ignoring setbacks and recognizing the limits of our possibilities. We know about the drug cultivation still going on in Afghanistan. We know about the corruption in the country and are concerned at reports of aid money being shunted out of the country. And we know about the heightened security situation./////Not everything is good in Afghanistan. Anyone who believes we can create European condi­tions in the Hindu Kush is mistaken. Our goal must be to help create a situation in Afghanistan which is good enough./////Good enough means that the Afghans themselves are in a position to ensure adequate stability in their country. Good enough means that the progress on human rights we have achieved since the fall of the Taliban is secured. Without human rights, without the right of women and girls to education, freedom of movement, participation in life, there can be no lasting stabili­zation in the country./////There is light and shade in Afghanistan. Many of you have held talks there and gained your own personal impression of the situation./////You know how dangerous the engagement in Afghanistan is for our soldiers./////In June alone, over 100 ISAF soldiers were killed. We mourn the seven German soldiers who have lost their lives in attacks by the Taliban in the past six months. We think of those who have suffered injuries-visible and invisible-in the course of their service. And our thoughts are with the families mourning a loved one or worrying about a relative because they know how dangerous this engagement is on a day-to-day basis./////I extend my most sincere respect and my deepest thanks to all those serving in Afghanistan, whether in uniform or as civilians, to all those risking their health, indeed their lives, in the PRTs, the Embassy or one of the many development projects. We value their work. We need their commitment and we hope for its success./////Germany is doing a lot in Afghanistan. In debates some reduce our commitment to the military components, others to the civilian elements./////We will not stabilize Afghanistan if we only take the military path. We will not stabilize Afghanistan by simply building schools, tarring roads and training police officers. Both are necessary and part of our networked security concept. But even the two together are not enough. We also need a third element://///A lasting self-sustaining stabilization of Afghanistan can only work through a political process that balances out the interests of the different ethnic and social groups in Afghanistan./////Here, too, we have already taken the first step with our Allies in London by introducing a reintegration programme for moderate Taliban who are seeking a way out./////A second step was the Peace Jirga which was held in Kabul in early June bringing together 1600 delegates, more than 20% of whom were women./////The discussions were very open, in part emotional. Participants reported from the meeting that conservative mullahs and women's representatives sat opposite one another but initially refused to look one another in the eye./////Tajik and Pashtun representatives apparently argued for a whole day about whether they should speak Pashto or Dari with one another./////On the third day however the Peace Jirga published a final document-with no votes against.//////////The 1600 delegates voted unanimously for the engagement of the international community in their country. They called upon their President to launch peace negotiations. They also made clear that reconciliation is only possible with those/////who renounce violence,/////who cut their ties to international terrorism,/////and who respect the Afghan Constitution and the resulting obligations to comply with international human rights standards./////This all shows that Afghanistan needs an Afghan solution. I am also saying that with a view to the parliamentary elections on 18 September. The political process must be an Afghan-led process if it is to be successful. Only the Afghan Government can make peace with their adversaries./////On the one hand, our task is to support this process. On the other, the international community has the job of drawing Afghanistan's neighbouring countries into this process. The aim is to bring Afghanistan's neighbouring countries to support the inter-Afghan peace process. Underpinning inter-Afghan results in the region will help secure what has been achieved./////The Kabul Conference will also play a role here./////The Kabul Conference will not be another donor conference at which the international community makes new pledges. In Kabul, the Afghan Government will for its part report on how it is progressing with fulfilling its obligations and on what concrete steps it is planning in the coming weeks and months. That is first and foremost the wish of the Afghans themselves as they have given this Conference the leitmotif of re-establishing the full sovereignty of their country./////Reintegration and reconciliation will be a central topic./////In London we agreed on the principles for a programme to reintegrate Taliban fighters into society. We will discuss this programme in detail in Kabul and then take a decision on releasing the funds that Germany has pledged./////We are expecting yet more answers from the Afghans at the Conference://///The Afghan Government will present concrete plans on how to improve its ability to govern and reduce corruption. A particular focus will be on governance in the provinces, districts and villages. This is where the Afghan citizens encounter their state. This is where they form an opinion on their Government and its legitimacy. Currently the deficits are greater here than in the capital Kabul. More needs to be done at this level so more responsibility can be transferred to Afghan institutions./////Together with NATO and the Afghan Government we will also adopt a plan in Kabul in which we lay down concrete conditions for deciding in which provinces responsibility for security can be passed to the Afghan security forces in the next year./////In 2011, next year, we want to transfer responsibility for three or four provinces. At least one of these will be in our sphere of responsibility in the north of the country./////As early as November, a fundamental decision is to be taken at the NATO Summit in Lisbon./////That doesn't mean that the Bundeswehr presence immediately loses its importance and that we no longer need soldiers there. Similarly, our civilian reconstruction aid also has a long-term perspective. But it is nevertheless a decisive step towards re-establishing Afghan sovereignty. And it is of course a central condition for starting to withdraw troops./////In the course of this legislative period we want to create the prerequisites so that we can begin to gradually wind down our military presence in Afghanistan./////This is a goal we are pursuing with determination and persistence and in close coordination with our Allies. Germany assumed responsibility in Afghanistan together with its Allies. Germany will not shirk this responsibility unilaterally./////The decisions on the German engagement in Afghanistan are amongst the most difficult decisions this Parliament has to take. The Federal Government will thus ensure not just that you are constantly and transparently informed across party lines about our engagement in Afghanistan but also that you are involved in shaping this engagement./////This is why it was today a matter of course for me as a Parliamentarian but also a priority for me personally to update you in the run-up to the International Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul on 20 July./////Thank you very much./////",0.2
Afghanistan situation,    24.11.2010 - Interview,"Interview with Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Rheinische Post of 24 November 2010 on the NATO Summit, the euro and Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ",Interview,"Question: For the first time NATO has made disarmament one of its stated goals. What good will that do us?/////I'm pushing so hard on disarmament because it's good for our own security. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are closely connected. We must prevent a situation in which more and more countries acquire nuclear weapons and eventually even terrorists get their hands on them. Disarmament is as vital for humanity as climate protection. After a decade of armament, it's time to launch a decade of disarmament./////Question: Is a world without nuclear weapons anything more than an illusion?/////It's a vision, but unlike a former German Chancellor, I believe we need visions in politics if we want to achieve anything long-term. Our Christian Democrat-Liberal coalition received a mandate to govern and it's our job to do what's right for our country. Disarmament is security policy, which is why it's a good thing this is now also NATO's business. Never before has disarmament been so high on NATO's agenda./////Question: At the NATO Summit Russia and Europe saw eye to eye in a way they never have in the past./////That the Russian President has been invited by NATO to participate in developing a joint missile defence system is a historic step. I was born in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built. I'd not yet turned 30 when courageous people in East Germany tore it down. Now, 20 years after German unity, those who during the Cold War confronted each other armed to the teeth are no longer adversaries but sit around the same table. That's a huge success./////Question: Can Russia become our friend, in the same way as France?/////The idea of friendship between Russia, Europe and us Germans is one we should cherish in our hearts. Partnership and modernization, however, must encompass more than merely economic matters. On freedom of expression and freedom of the press, on civil rights and the rule of law there are differences of opinion. Despite this, I feel we're on the right track./////Question: The euro crisis goes on and on.Can it put the European Union's political existence at risk?/////First of all, it's clear how right it was to put the rescue package in place. And how wrong the Opposition was, after the Red-Green coalition had watered down the Stability Pact, to then refuse to tackle the consequences of this historic mistake. Unlike early on with Greece, we are actually now prepared and we have a tool for managing the situation. I see no risk of contagion, by the way, as every case is different. What's important is for a rigorous policy of budget consolidation to be pursued everywhere in Europe./////Question: Is it conceivable for you that bankrupt countries will be forced to leave the European Union?/////No. Europe is the most successful peace project in the history of our continent, it's the insurance policy that keeps us prosperous. The euro is a currency of peace. It would be crazy for us Germans of all people to forget how important Europe is for us. That we can live in peace in this European house of ours is a great boon. If you share a house with 26 other people, of course you're sometimes annoyed by the loud music or the chores left undone. What's crucial, however, is to strengthen the foundations of our house. For that we need an effective crisis mechanism and a tightening-up of the Stability Pact. This must include effective sanctions as well as, from 2013 on, the involvement of private-sector creditors. To make the taxpayer liable for any and every investment risk is just not on./////Question: In Afghanistan troop withdrawal is now drawing nearer.What happens if Afghan President Hamid Karzai asks Germany to stay longer?/////It was the Afghan Government that set itself the goal of taking full responsibility for national security by 2014. We are supporting Afghan efforts here, for that's how withdrawal of our troops will become a concrete prospect. The mission in Afghanistan can't go on for ever. If the handover is successful, the last combat troops should leave the country in 2014. This doesn't mean, however, that from then on we won't be taking any responsibility in Afghanistan for things like civilian development or security forces training./////(...)/////The interviewers wereMichael Brocker and Gregor Mayntz./////",0.1
Afghanistan situation,    18.11.2010 - Interview,"Foreign Minister Westerwelle in an interview with Financial Times on the NATO's Strategic Concept, Afghanistan und the situation in the eurozone - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"Source: www.ft.comQuestion: Looking to the Nato summit in Lisbon, are you satisfied with the newstrategic concept, or do you want further amendments?Foreign Minister Westerwelle: Some of Germany's core concerns have been taken into account.The proposals made by the Nato secretary-general are a very good basis. Itis clear that Nato sees itself as a political union of values, and also asa defence alliance it supports the need for disarmament and nuclearnonproliferation. The invitation to Russia to take part in a missiledefence system is of historic importance. The fact that President Medvedevwants to go to Lisbon shows how important that invitation is to Russia. Inmy conversations in Moscow with the Russian government, especially withForeign Minister Lavrov, I got the clear impression that they want to studythe details objectively. That alone is huge progress. I can´t anticipatethe speech of President Medvedev. But look, 20 years after Europe wasreunited after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall, Nato is making an offer toRussia to take part in a defence and security project. There are threepossible responses: to reject it out of hand; to accept it unchecked; or toengage in constructive discussions. That Russia has decided on the thirdway is very welcome.Question: Will the allies themselves agree?Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.Question: Do you think that agreement on a missile defence system will openthe way to further nuclear disarmament?The American government under President Obama has set thecourse with its nuclear posture review. That reduces the strategicimportance of nuclear weapons. As long as there are nuclear weapons in theworld, we in our defence alliance will have to rely on nuclear deterrence.But the way to a nuclear free world depends on confidence-building throughnuclear and other forms of disarmament. After a decade of setbacks fordisarmament, our initiatives seemed to be little more than a trickle. Nowwe´ve got a considerable tide moving. /////In New York we founded a group ofstates from all regions of the world that feel particularly committed tothe goals of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation - Japan, Australiaand Germany are in the lead. And this time the nuclear non-proliferationconference in New York was a success, unlike when it last met five yearsago. The new Start treaty has been agreed. We are counting on its beingratified by the US and Russia. So the debate over nuclear zero is in fullflow round the world. Why are disarmament and nuclear disarmament soimportant? Because they are a commitment that gives us the authority todemand nuclear non-proliferation (from others). Disarmament and nuclearnon-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. If we in the West, if thenuclear powers, disarm, then they will be much more credible in insistingthat other states should not acquire nuclear weapons.Question: But the Americans do not wish to withdraw their medium-rangemissiles from Germany, as you want.I can only respect and applaud the American government forgiving momentum to the disarmament debate. The vision of a nuclear zerowhich the American president talked about in his outstanding speech inPrague is now part of that debate. And that is why I am very happy aboutthe close partnership both with the USA and in particular with my Americancounterpart Hillary Clinton. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is basedon three pillars.1.Anyone can use nuclear energy if they are committed to internationaltransparencyand co-operation.2.The nuclear powers will disarm, so that3.the international community can demand with special authority that no oneelse arms themselves with nuclear weapons.Question: Do you not have a problem with France over your desire to have anarms control committee set up within Nato, while the French want to stressthe importance of nuclear weapons in the new strategic doctrine?/////I would not describe it as a problem, but rather as anecessary discussion in preparation for convergence of different,historically based points of view. France has been a nuclear power fordecades, just like Britain, and naturally has a different attitude when itcomes to the role of nuclear weapons to what we have for example inGermany. We have learned the lessons of our history. But at the G8 summitin 2009, France also recognised the goal of a world without nuclearweapons. So the fct that we need to discuss the question is perfectlynormal. /////We are 28 Nato member states, and naturally they need to bringtheir different positions closer together. Let me tell you straight out:the Nato strategic concept will protect our common security interests, andaddress new challenges, stress our community of values, and - reallyrevolutionary for a defence alliance - also emphasise the role ofdisarmament for global security. Every concept sets a goal and at the sametime amounts to an agreement on common action. That is why it is astrategic concept. The last Nato concept was agreed in 1999. After Lisbonyou should just do one thing: look at the old concept of 1999 beside thenew concept. I am sure that the role of disarmament will clearly be givenmore weight.Question: Is there not a danger that this new concept will push Nato in thedirection of become a global policeman. Am I justified in fearing that?We are sticking to the core commitment of Nato in Article V.That means we will defend ourselves in the case of any armed attack. We arenot going to water that down. But it is equally clear that everything Natodoes in the future will be in accordance with international law. Ourbehaviour is in accordance with international law. /////There are certainly newthreats that have arisen that we did not foresee in previous years, such asterrorist threats, or the danger of the spread of weapons of massdestruction. That should not just be considered from the point of view ofstates arming themselves and therefore making whole regions unstable. Ontop of that, the more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the greateris the danger of terrorist groups or other criminal organisations gettingtheir hands on nuclear weapons potential. And 20 people with one atom bombis an army.Question: But is it the job of Nato to find these people and destroy them?We have been fighting together against terrorism for a longtime, including on the instructions of the United Nations. We and many ofthe other Nato member states are in Afghanistan with a UN mandate. That wasthe difference with the war in Iraq. We are in Afghanistan on the basis ofa Un decision, clearly based on international law.Question: Is Gaza the sort of place you can see Nato operating in apeacekeeping capacity?/////I think that regional conflict resolution must stem from theparties to the conflict, and above all must be supported by the UN. The UNis an organisation, especially the Security Council, that gets involvedaround the world in the solution of regional conflicts and the promotion ofregional stability. In my view, the UN role cannot be replaced by any othersort of defence alliance.Question: But when is a terrorist attack part of a regional conflict, and whenis it an attack on Nato itself?You can´t say that abstractly or theoretically. One must judgeon a caseby- case basis. What we are working on is conflict prevention,above all else.Question: That is an integral part of it. The new strategic concept is part ofthe worldwide reaction to September 11_and a great deal more. We have so many new challenges. Thedanger of weapons of mass destruction, the danger of computer attacks,so-called asymmetric threats. And moreover, we haven´t just got Article V,we also have Article IV, for example regarding consultation in thealliance.Question: You have talked of computer wars, and I must confess that I amastonished that this strategic concept does not attempt to change Article Vto allow for mutual defence against computer attacks.The debates will only take place when we get to Lisbon. Wemight as well give up the summit if I tell you about the whole concept now!Question: But how are we going to deal with computer wars, how can we organiseourselves against them? As you said, that is one of the big new dangers. Wealready saw that in Estonia and in Georgia, and interestingly most recentlyin Iran. What should the Nato summit do to defend us all against thisdanger?Well that is precisely the sort of question which requiresinternational co-operation, even beyond Nato. I am no technical expert, andalso no computer specialist who can give you a practical answer. We havealso had a thorough discussion of this in our federal government, what weshould do against such computer attacks. In American or British English youseem to speak very easily of war. I would avoid that. You speak of war_Question: Like cyber war_Precisely, and I speak rather of computer attacks, because theword war is more easily and frequently used in English. You have a waragainst climate change, don´t you?Question: Yes.In English one talks rather easily about a war against this orthat. In Germany we are very cautious about using the word war. That is whywe don´t speak of a computer war, but of computer attacks.Question: Or of armed conflicts?Certainly not! We are speaking of attacks. The precisetranslation simply has another resonance, the meaning is more loaded. It´sno wonder. I am speaking of computer attacks, and we will naturally alsodiscuss these questions. That is why I pointed out that we don´t just haveArticle V. There are also further questions of cooperation andconsultation, that is all part of it.Question: But in Estonia the whole financial and government system came undercomputer attacks. And Estonia was already a Nato member, but Nato could notdo anything about it.Perhaps so, because we must first become more technicallycompetent to defend with such new challenges. But that is not the job ofheads of state and government, or for foreign ministers, or even defenceministers. We have to agree on a strategy. We determine that there is achallenge that concerns our security, and then naturally we must talk aboutthe details of how we find an appropriate answer, which should beproportional, efficient and focussed.Question: If it is clear that such attacks come from Russia, how is itpossible to have a closer cooperation with the Russians?I know of suspicions, but no proof.Question: Can I ask you about Afghanistan? It is clear that the Germanpopulation is not enthusiastic about this ""armed conflict"". How long canyou ensure the population still supports your involvement? How long can youstay in the country?In Lisbon we will begin the process of handing overresponsibility, by making it clear that next year we will hand overresponsibility for security to Afghanistan and Afghan authorities in thefirst provinces. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to have handedover responsibility for security entirely to the Afghan government during2014. /////So we are opening up a perspective of withdrawal. If we begin to handover responsibility for security in the coming months, that should not beconfused with beginning a troop withdrawal, but as a precondition formaking our withdrawal possible one day in the future.Question: The Americans say that we Europeans do not do enough to convince ourvoters that this war is worthwhile. Is the future of Nato itself notendangered by the war in Afghanistan?I see a lot of shadows and many setbacks - especially with thesecurity situation. But I also see some light and many good developments.Take the elections, which are part of good governance: Naturally theelections are rightly criticised because of attempts at manipulation, butthe good thing is what is happening from Afghanistan itself. It isimportant progress that the first mandates that were awarded because ofmanipulation at the count were immediately cancelled. These were the firstelections in Afghanistan that took place under Afghan supervision. Therewas not only higher voter participation, but also a lot of complaints fromthe population itself, from Afghans themselves, and the Afghan authoritiesdrew their conclusions. They cancelled elections that were won throughmanipulation, and that is remarkable. /////I find it healthy that Germans have afundamentally sceptical attitude towards foreign (military) deployments.That is because of the dreadful first half of the last century. At the sametime, Germans live up to their international responsibility in an exemplaryfashion, considering for example that they are the third largest supplierof international troops. /////Both parties in the government have stated thatthey support the intervention in Afghanistan, and they have a majority forthat view. The same people who are inwardly sceptical about foreignmilitary interventions - which I find a justified view - have alsorecognised the necessity and given those parties a big majority insupporting the Afghan intervention. Both poles shape our foreign policy:the culture of military restraint, and at the same time, the recognition ofour international responsibility. Germany is an excellent model in that.Question: Has Germany changed in the past 20 years, since unification? Iremember Helmut Kohl saying he could not conceive of a German soldierserving in the Balkans.Yes. Germany has changed since reunification. This process hasbeen strenuously thought through both in society and in the democraticprocess. If you think of our engagement in the western Balkans, that´s agood example of how successful the intervention of our soldiers can by instabilising the situation, for we were able to reduce our troop numbers inKFOR massively, from 8,500 to just 2,500 today. /////In the meantime, President Tadic has worked through a policy changetowards Kosovo. In Vukovar, in Croatia, he made a remarkable speechapologising for the massacre committed by Serbian troops. /////So things are moving in the right direction there. Iwould also mention the fight against pircy. The impression is given thereas if it was just a question of economic interests. If it´s a question ofprotecting our shipping ands therefore ensuring that aid can get to Africa.That was the starting point of the exercise, and it is succeeding.Question: But in terms of power projection internationally, do you thinkGermans really believe in it? Or will there be a great battle in societyover every future military intervention, wherever it may be?I have just said I am happy that we have a healthy scepticismtowards military interventions of the Bundeswehr. There is nothing wrongwith that. Some foreign politicians may see it as a lack of firmness, butonly if they have not really studied the darkest chapter in our history.Unlike most of our alliance partners, we have a parliamentary army. Thatmeans that every foreign intervention must be approved by our parliament -with a proposal from the government, but decided by the parliament. All ourfriends in the world should be happy that Germany has drawn its lessonsfrom history, and not just in the federal constitution, with its principleof a parliamentary army rather than a government army, but also it is avital element in society, given the readiness both to take internationalresponsibility, and to have a healthy scepticism and a culture of militaryrestraint that lies deep in the hearts of our people. I am proud of boththings.Question: In Brussels many people are saying that Germany has also changed itsattitude towards Europe since reunification - that Germany is more insistent on itsnational interests, and has become very tough in the whole saga of theeurozone crisis. What would you say about that?/////In the preamble of the constitution of the German FederalRepublic stand the two core principles of its foreign policy: to servepeace in the world in a united Europe. Because of that, Germany won a twothirds majority outright in the UN, against two very respectablecandidates, in the first vote (for a seat on the Security Council), becausewe have made multilateralism and European integration our politicalprinciples. /////In my first year as foreign minister I visited all the Europeanmember states, and not just big France and Britain, or Poland, Italy andSpain, but also others like Luxembourg, the three Baltic states and Malta.We regard our European policy as a partnership on the same level for allmember states, whether they are bigger or smaller, and whether they areeconomically more successful or unfortunately for a while rather lesssuccessful.Question: But what about this agreement in Deauville between France andGermany: all the rest had to fall in with it. Don´t you think you stressyour relationship with France too much in an enlarged EU?At the very beginning of my time in office, I revived theso called Weimar triangle. That is the close partnership between France,Poland and Germany. This Weimar triangle has become an important motor inthe EU, alongside the close partnership between France and Germany that hasgrown up over decades.Question: But the eurozone is different?As far as the stability culture is concerned we have manyallies precisely amongst those who joined the EU in the last years.Question: But the Poles weren´t happy about the Deauville deal with France.What counts is what was finally agreed.Question: Are you happy with that?/////I am happy that the Chancellor was able to successfullynegotiate what we agreed in the cabinet after Deauville would be thenegotiating mandate. Three points are most important. First, thatviolations of responsible budget planning do not remain unpunished, andpolitical opportunism must as far as possible not interfere with impositionof sanctions. /////I am one of those who, as a member of the opposition in theBundestag, criticised the relaxation of the stability pact-at Germany´sinstigation - in 2004/5 as a historic mistake. Unfortunately the partiesthat were in government then, and are now in opposition, have refused tosupport the solution to the problems caused by their own mistaken decision.Second, the creation of a crisis mechanism, which will not be a (EU)community instrument, because that would mean creating a form of legalliability that would not be acceptable in our German legal system. /////Third, we do not want to relieve private creditors of their responsibility.Those who bet against countries, and loses those bets, and yet can gohome with their profits untouched, they won´t be let off. That must change.Question: Do you agree with the Chancellor that if the Euro fails, then Europewill fail?/////Neither the euro, nor Europe, will fail. That is why theChancellor and I as foreign minister are working for its success. I am aEuropean patriot.Question: What does that mean?It means that I am one of the first politicians in the countrywho is happy to say publicly that I am proud of my country - and that waslong before the World Cup in 2006. I see Germany as embedded in a Europe ofvalues and co-operation. For me Europe is much more than a common currency,and far more than a system to ensure our welfare at a time ofglobalisation, much more than an internal market and the freedom to travel./////For me, Europe is a community of values. It is a political union thatserves both peace and freedom. Therefore the euro is a currency of freedom,and not just a means of exchange. The European model of co-operation isdemanding, arduous, nerve-wracking even, and the negotiations often go onall night. And the European model of co-operation also costs money,although a lot less than it would cost to eliminate the sort of conflictsthat regularly occurred in past centuries. The model of co-operation hastaken over from the model of confrontation. And that is an unbelievablegood fortune for our generation. You are sitting here in a building aroundwhich everything was bombed to bits in the war. You are sitting in a placethat was the source of oppression in a socialist dictatorship. In one hourby car you can be in Poland, and there are no more border conflicts. /////For the first time since Germany existed, it is surrounded by friendly stateswho have organised themselves under a single European roof. Anyone who doesnot love Europe can´t be helped. They´re just thoughtless. If you takeEurope for granted, then you will begin to lose it, and that isextraordinarily dangerous. I see disturbing tendencies towardsrenationalisation, regrettably both in Europe and in many countries of theworld. But it is our task to oppose this tendency wherever it may be found.Question: But I read some awful articles in Bild Zeitung about Greece earlierthis year. That worried me a bit.I ask you: there are always debates and bad ideas, in bar-roomconversations and in the media, but we are talking now about responsiblepolicy. You must have a clear compass, and mine has one clear co-ordinate,and that is Europe.Question: One last question: were you not rather disappointed that PresidentObama said in Delhi that he supported India´s desire to become a permanentmember of the UN Security Council? He has never said it about Germany.President Obama was speaking to the Indian and not the Germanparliament. If he had not supported India for the Security Council in hisspeech, it would have been a strange omission. I expect that he will make asimilarly friendly remark in Japan, where he is going at the end of theweek.Question: And then you´ll invite him to the Bundestag?When he next has time to visit Germany I will be delighted tohear the friendly words that President Obama, a man I greatly admire, willfind for both Brazil and Germany./////(The questions were posed by Quentin Peel and Gerritt Wiesmann)//////////",0.1
Information security,    22.10.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Minister of State Hoyer at the German-Polish-Russian Seminar at NATO, Brussels, 22.10.2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"__ translation of advanced text __/////Euro-Atlantic Security-Perceptions and Realities/////German-Polish-Russian Seminar at NATO: Enhanced Cooperation and Security For All __enewed Commitment/////Brussels, 22 October 2010/////It is a great pleasure for me to be able to participate in this trilateral seminar. Not too long ago it would have been difficult to imagine high-level representatives of the governments of Poland, Russia and Germany coming together within the framework of NATO to hold a joint seminar on issues of Euro-Atlantic security./////A positive development has begun in the past two years./////The conclusion of the New START Treaty in April of this year represented a major step. This milestone is based on the new trust between the Russian and US leaderships. We view President Obama's and President Medvedev's support for the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons as the commitment of both sides to further steps towards nuclear disarmament. The withdrawal of substrategic nuclear weapons is of particularly great importance to us Germans./////The Russian Government has taken significant steps towards building confidence in Europe. The resolution of the Barents Sea border issue with Norway represents an important increase in security. Let me give special attention to the rapprochement between Russia and Poland, which has led to a thaw in Russian-European relations in general and opens up new oppor­tunities for dialogue with Russia. Both sides are determined to overcome difficult past issues and look to the future./////It is to the credit of President Medvedev that his proposal for a new European security treaty has contributed significantly to a new perception of pan-European security. His initiative turned again to the unfulfilled promise of the Charter of Paris to establish indivisible security as the basis for mutual confidence and unified action./////A comprehensive dialogue within OSCE on Europe's common security has grown out of this. Numerous proposals for improved cooperation and security as well as for confidence-building have been developed as part of the Corfu Process. Now we must seize the opportunity that the OSCE Summit in Astana represents. The Astana Summit must provide concrete impulses and mandates aimed at strengthening common security in Europe./////To us, the concept of indivisible security, which President Medvedev has rightly emphasized, means the rejection of zero-sum logic. From our perspective the principle that security can be strengthened only in harmony, not in confrontation, means that greater security for the other side also implies greater security for oneself. To this end we must do away with the notion of spheres of influence and power, as it does not help us but, on the contrary, merely raises the spectre of new conflicts./////This thinking requires that both sides go the extra mile: For Russia this means over­coming the fear of its interests being impinged upon. We in the West have to try to place our trust in Russia's constructive role./////I have previously spoken of the need for a community of shared interests. Concrete steps of cooperation are needed to achieve this. Trust grows through joint action. In the area of Euro-Atlantic security I see this call going out especially to the NATO-Russia Council, EU__ussia relations and the OSCE./////Given the positive development of our relations, relations between NATO and Russia have also improved considerably. In Afghanistan, Russia and NATO have clear common interests in fighting terrorism, Islamist fundamentalism, and drug production and trafficking. Russia trains Afghans in the fight against drugs and also wants to provide Afghanistan with military equipment as part of an agreement with NATO. Russia's support for NATO in the transport of material and equipment to Afghanistan is also of particular importance./////There are also good prospects for cooperation between NATO and Russia to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. Agreement on the objectives has largely been reached in the NATO-Russia Council./////All in all, dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council has developed well since the Informal Foreign Ministers Meeting in Corfu. Thus I think there is a good chance of broadening the spectrum of topics. We, for example, are very open to the Russian proposal to conduct dialogue on defence planning. The field of reorganization of armed forces and joint military exercises on the basis of jointly elaborated threat scenarios also offers further scope for dialogue and cooperation./////How we address missile defence will be crucial for future relations between Russia and the West. Germany is a strong advocate of involving Russia as far as possible. We believe NATO-based missile defence can only further European security if Russia is on board. A call goes out here to NATO and Russia to use the opportunity for cooperation which would bring about a long-term and truly strategic improvement in NATO-Russia relations. Therefore I have read precisely the words of President Medwedew expressing readiness to explore ways by which Russia's active participation in a joint missile defence system might be possible./////The first step has been taken by drawing up a common threat analysis regarding joint missile defence in the NATO-Russia Council. But I see much further-reaching potential, from the passing on of technical information, knowing how sensitive the issue is, via the joint development of components, to the inter­connection of the surveillance and defence systems in the various areas./////At the forthcoming Summit in Lisbon, NATO will adopt its New Strategic Concept and therein commit to its partnership with Russia, in very clear and credible terms. ""Partners, not adversaries"" should also be the maxim for the Russian percep­tion of NATO. Were Russia to deal accordingly with NATO in its military and security doctrines, it would be an encouraging confidence-building response./////The German government is highly delighted that President Medvedev agreed to a NATO-Russia Council Summit in Lisbon. This provides a real opportunity for the two sides to move closer together./////Russia's cooperation with the EU is the other key component in relations between Russia and the West./////Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union. The European Union needs Russia just as Russia needs the European Union. This holds true not only in the business sphere and regarding energy security, but also in the sphere of security policy./////With the Treaty of Lisbon and the establishment of the European External Action Service, the European Union is putting its common foreign policy and the effectiveness of it on a new footing. This presents new opportunities for closer and more operational foreign and security policy collaboration between the EU and Russia. The EU is interested in conducting this kind of security dialogue and is prepared to raise it to a new level./////The Meseberg Initiative of President Medvedev and Federal Chancellor Merkel has been an important trigger in lending a new quality to security policy relations. Linked to this is the plan to move forward together on resolving the Transnistria conflict. Transnistria is cer­tainly a kind of test-drive of our ability to jointly overcome mutual blockades. Russian influence is vital given its financial, military and political support. But Romania is also called upon to help bring about a solution./////Progress in Transnistria would step up confidence considerably and lend weight to Presi­dent Medvedev's call for indivisible security in Europe. Such progress would also be a promising signal for the OSCE Summit in Astana. After all, it is at this Summit that key momentum is needed for the development of a pan-European security order./////Such momentum clearly also includes elements to prompt a strengthening and renewal of conventional arms control in Europe./////Adapting and modernizing the CFE Treaty is a sine qua non for creating European security and a major confidence-building step between Russia and its Western neighbours./////A successful development of the CFE negotiations with a view to a Treaty ratified by all parties would also have a positive impact on the issue of NATO's and Russia's substrategic nuclear weapons in Europe. You know that my Government is working for the withdrawal of NATO's tactical nuclear weapons from Germany and Europe-an issue we are consulting intensively with our Allies. From a military and security policy perspective they do not make sense any longer. But we also consider it essential for Russia to with­draw its much larger arsenals of substrategic nuclear weapons from Europe. First steps could be transparency measures and central storage of warheads./////",0.1
Information security,    01.07.2010 - Speech,"Opening speech by Guido Westerwelle, at the international conference ""Remembering the Second World War-Memorials and Museums in Central and Eastern Europe"" - Federal Foreign Office ",International Conference,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Dr Kunert,/////Professor Tschurbarian, Professor Troebst,/////Dr Beggreen-Merkel,/////Excellencies,/////Bundestag colleagues,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Sixty-five years after the Second World War ended, the way we remember it is changing. The period of ""remembering"" by those immediately involved or affected is drawing to a close./////Now only a few witnesses to the events remain. There is very little time left for grandchildren and great-grandchildren to ask questions./////Soon we will no longer be able to trace the fates of individuals in encounters with living persons and their stories will remain for ever untold. Later generations have gradually replaced ""remembrance"" with the desire to ""commemorate something""./////Those who can no longer experience contemporary witnesses first hand are dependent on written and other records. These may be found in history books and memoirs but also in video recordings and TV documentaries./////The image of the Second World War is increasingly influenced by film narratives in the cinema. Many associate films such as ""Das Boot"" and ""Schindler's List"" with the period./////Ladies and gentlemen,/////History has far too often torn the nations of Europe apart. Commemoration must not be instrumentalized so that it blocks the path to the future./////Every nation, every people, looks back on its history in its own unique way. This is especially true when it comes to memories of the Second World War. The national point of view is both inevitable and legitimate./////In Russia the siege of Leningrad, in which the German Wehrmacht drove the people to starva­tion, is etched in the collective memory./////In Poland it is the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 that is imprinted on the collective memory./////The key issue with regard to our common future in Europe is how the different memories of Europeans converge. This begins with knowledge and understanding of the experiences of our neighbours. A peaceful Europe needs a dialogue on the collective and cultural memories of all./////In the next few days you will be able to exchange your viewpoint with that of your European neighbours. The organizers of this conference and its speakers come from Poland, Russia and Germany. In addition there are the viewpoints of participants from other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Viewing the world with our neighbour's eyes enables us to see ourselves more clearly./////Memories of the Second World War are inextricably linked to the annihilation of European Jewry. Germany accepts its responsibility for the Shoah. The Shoah is an immutable part of the collective memory in Germany./////That we in Israel and Germany can look on amicable relations 65 years after the end of the War is something that fills me with immense gratitude. It is precisely because we are prepared to face the historical truth, to look back, that we are also able to look together towards the future./////Part of the conference programme includes visits to four Berlin memorial sites. These sites reflect the contradictions and the change in the nature of remembrance in Germany when it was divided and since reunification. The Soviet Memorial in Treptower Park and the German-Russian Museum in the Karlshorst district of Berlin illustrate the development from remebrance of the victor to a remembrance shared by the victor and the defeated. The Monument of the Polish Soldier and the German Anti-Fascist in the Second World War erected in 1972 is one example of the official remembrance culture in the GDR. The Topography of Terror memorial commemorates all victims of the Gestapo, the SS and the Reich Security Main Office. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe beside the Brandenburg Gate is a national memorial commemorating the Shoah, that most atrocious crime against humanity./////Amongst German memories of the War are the night-time bombing raids on Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden, and also the fate of those Germans who lost their home as a result of the War. The fact that we can speak openly of these events today is thanks to the rapprochement and reconciliation that have taken place in Europe./////When we think of the German victims, we never forget Germany's responsibility. We remember them in complete awareness of Germany's responsibility for unleashing the Second World War. We think of what we did to Poles and Russians in their millions. Germany's enduring historical responsibility is beyond any doubt./////It took decades in Germany before we submitted ourselves to the task of remembering. Germany struggled for a long time after 1945 to achieve transparency when dealing with our country's history./////The history of remembrance of the Second World War had long been a history of forgetting and repressing, of taboos and veils of silence. The Auschwitz Trial in Frankfurt from 1963, Chancellor Willy Brandt falling to his knees in Warsaw, President Richard von Weizsäcker's speech marking the fortieth anniversary of the end of the War-all these are examples of how Germans have constantly reminded their fellow Germans of their responsibility./////The debate over what constitutes an appropriate way to remember goes on. With every act of remembrance, with every story we tell, with every image we conjure up, we are to a certain extent re-creating the past. Every silence and dissimulation, every omission and failure to pass on information shapes the past./////Showing respect for victims and acknowledging their suffering does not mean disrespect for others who have also suffered. When we recall the suffering of the Sinti and Roma, of homosexuals, of people persecuted for their political beliefs, that does not imply disrespect for the incalculable suffering of the murdered Jews of Europe./////Our remembrance of the suffering of millions of murdered Poles and Russians does not diminish the suffering of others. We owe remembrance to all victims. Their suffering is part of historical truth. The principle ""Against Forgetting"" applies to all./////Outside this hall, in the foyer, there is a cabinet displaying the protocol of the Wannsee Conference in 1942. There you can see a map bearing the signatures of Ribbentrop and Stalin. It was part of the Hitler-Stalin Pact of August 1939 and showed the division of Poland and where the border between the German Reich and the Soviet Union was to be drawn./////I name these two examples because they have played a particular role in the struggle for historical truth. Working on the sources, on establishing historical facts, is one of the first tasks of any responsible engagement with history./////Free and independent research is crucial to determining the facts. Determining historical truth is not a matter for the state but for academic research./////Researchers need free access to all historical sources. They must be able to question, interpret and disagree without hindrance. I wish you a productive debate over the next few days./////If a nation's collective memory creates a point on which identity and peaceful co-existence within a state hinges, then it raises the question as to whether Europe can exist in the long term without a similar linchpin. Do we need some kind of European collective memory? If yes, how is it to emerge?/////In the past there have been many attempts to make provision for remembrance at state level. However, historical truth is not an object of negotiation, nor do ossified rituals serve anyone./////It is more important to allow time for an impartial discussion on the content and limitations of remembrance than to find ready answers. The process itself is part of active remembrance./////A few days ago here in Berlin, Hans-Dietrich Genscher looked back on the Two Plus Four Treaty. He said it was a matter of ""Remembering, and wanting something new"". This is precisely what reconciliation within Europe is about. Russia and Poland have achieved a great deal along the path of remembrance and reconciliation with Germany./////That a German Chancellor should be a guest in Moscow on 9 May at the memorial ceremony to mark the anniversary of the end of the War would have been unthinkable twenty years ago. That a Federal Chancellor should give a speech in Gdansk on 1 September to mark the anniversary of Germany's invasion of Poland would still have been regarded as a utopian dream even a few years ago. Last year it became reality./////Poland and Russia discuss their common past with a new openness also in the context of their bilateral relations. I found the sympathy extended towards the Polish people in their grief following the tragic plane crash at Smolensk in Russia deeply moving./////In Europe we can unite to transform places of horror and suffering into places of commemoration and remembrance. Places of reconciliation can thus emerge over time./////A few days ago in Warsaw I spoke about the fact that our friendship with Poland is of cardinal importance and does not take second place to our friendship with France./////As part of the European Union, Poland has decided over our common future since 2004./////Just as we have succeeded in producing a joint history textbook with France, so we can do the same with Poland. Looking together at our-in so many respects-difficult history allows us to look together towards a better future./////Germany, Poland and Russia are daring to break new ground in our triangular relationship. We work together on a common, trilateral basis. This Conference is the second of its kind. Last year in Warsaw historians, many of whom are here today, talked about the genesis of the Second World War./////We talk about the past, but also about the future. The policy planning staffs of the three Foreign Ministries also openly discuss sensitive issues relating to European security. We talk about relations between NATO and Russia and joint projects in the OSCE. The Foreign Ministries of our three countries want to come together soon at deputy foreign minister level./////The dialogue between Russia, Poland and Germany concerning both past and future goes on. It is essential that there should be trust between our three countries. Our freedom in Europe can only endure if there is mutual and undivided security from Vancouver to Vladivostok./////I intend to work consistently towards this goal together with my Polish, Russian and European colleagues./////",0.1
Sustainable development,    15.03.2010 - Speech,Address by Guido Westerwelle at the German-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __///////////////Mr Governor,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Let me first of all thank you most sincerely for this invitation./////In the coming years, the world will look to Brazil to a greater extent than perhaps ever before./////Just a few years ago, we in Germany experienced to what degree global sporting events shape a country's image. The motto of summer 2006 was ""A time to make friends"". That wasn't an advertising slogan, it was reality. Even those who would never dream of going to a stadium on a Saturday to watch a league game couldn't escape the enthusiasm which gripped the entire country./////No-one who was there has forgotten how people sat or stood in the streets or in cafes and celebrated together./////No-one will forget the friendly atmosphere which was palpable at every street corner./////People all around the world recall the images of laughter and cheers, and of tears, too, which flowed when a team was eliminated from the tournament./////That's what sport is all about: it's about the competition, about the best performance, about fair play, about skill and talent, as well as about emotions which touch everyone./////What we're talking about today attracts less attention. The images I've just described can only materialize if planning and organization are coordinated to perfection. The preparation is successful if it is no longer consciously perceived once the first game kicks off./////The questions which you in Rio de Janeiro must answer are the same as the ones we in Germany had to answer prior to the 2006 World Cup./////I'd like to mention just a few./////How can stadia be used meaningfully once the final is over and the Cup has been presented? How can transport links be planned so that new bus and train routes serve the local population in the long term? How can investments help to make cities safer, cleaner and more attractive to live in?/////And how can the population be involved in the planning so that people accept and take advantage of the changes these developments entail?/////Sport will change Rio de Janeiro. You're therefore right to look now at what happens after the World Cup./////I'm delighted that you are doing so in collaboration with German business./////For German business gained valuable experience in how to make global sporting events a success when it helped to prepare the World Cup in Germany./////We should see the World Cup and the Olympic Games as shared opportunities to set the course for the future in Rio./////Cooperation has already begun. Architects and construction companies from Germany were sought-after partners for the World Cup in South Africa and the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. And German architects are currently planning four World Cup stadia in Brazil./////Following reunification, Germany renewed-and in some cases built from scratch-large parts of the transport and communications infrastructure in eastern Germany./////We can put this experience to use in the coming years. For transport-especially on medium-range routes, Germany developed state-of-the-art trains which combine eco-friendliness and speed. Just take the high-speed ICE train, which only takes 90 minutes to travel between Germanys largest two cities, Berlin and Hamburg. That's a distance of just under 300 kilometres. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are only about 50 kilometres further apart./////Alongside transport, energy supply also offers opportunities for close cooperation. Regenerative energies are being used more both inside and outside the stadia./////Germany leads the world when it comes to solar energy-and to wind energy, too, for that matter. If we join forces, we will send key messages about Brazil's long-term energy supply strategy./////German business has launched the Initiative WinWin 2014/16 for the sporting events of the coming decade./////Within this framework, German companies are positioning themselves to prepare for potential projects in connection with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Games./////I'm delighted that the Chairman of this initiative, Dr Zoller, is accompanying me on this tour. I'm confident that the Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro will do everything it can to support these projects./////The Initiative demonstrates how important German-Brazilian economic relations are. Our economies are closely linked to one another. I believe I speak for everyone present when I say that I hope our relations will be even more intensive in future./////My trip has taken me to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil because I wanted to gain a first-hand impression of your continent's dynamism./////The impressions I take home with me will go into the strategy on Latin America on which the German Government is currently working./////I have emphasized time and again during my trip that we have to shape globalization positively. The fact that as Foreign Minister I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal is an important part of that.//////////",0.1
Sustainable development,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1

Germany will be represented by Werner Hoyer, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office./////The meeting of the nine states that border the Baltic Sea along with Iceland and Norway presents an opportunity to discuss economic development in the region, the progress of the reforms introduced at the 2008 summit in Riga and current aspects of regional cooperation. The Lithuanian chair, which will hand over its duties to Norway on 1 July, hopes to reach agreement on a summit declaration that outlines prospects for the development of the Baltic Sea region, especially in the areas of business, social affairs and the environment./////Together with its partners on the CBSS, the German Government wants to take advantage of the diverse opportunities offered by cooperation in the Baltic Sea region by taking a stronger project-oriented approach and improving coordination with other regional bodies such as the Northern Dimension./////The Council of the Baltic Sea States was founded in 1992 as the result of a joint initiative by Germany and Denmark. The Heads of State and Government summits have taken place every two years since the first summit was held in 1996. The long-term priorities of this cooperation in the Baltic Sea region include economic development, a sustainable and secure energy supply, environmental protection, education and culture and civil security.//////////",0.1
Sustainable development,    02.05.2010 - Speech,Dinner Speech by Guido Westerwelle on the occasion of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue - Federal Foreign Office ,International Conference,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Excellencies,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to my home town. Bonn is where I grew up, I went to university here, and the Rhineland is also my political home./////The Federal Government Guest House here on the Petersberg has a long history. In the past major international conferences have been successfully held in this venue. The name Peters­berg stands for peace and security through international cooperation. With this in mind, I would like to wish us all a successful conference./////The fight against climate change is one of the central issues of the 21st century. This theme is closely related to the city of Bonn. As Germany's main United Nations site, Bonn hosts, for example, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change./////The Federal Government wants to promote and further develop Bonn as a UN location. This is also an expression of our commitment to the UN itself./////The global economic and financial crisis has not slowed down or halted the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of an advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely to arise owing to a scarcity of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must stop global problems turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops according to a set of rules and values in order to preserve peace and security in the long term./////Climate change is one of the key challenges facing humanity. The consequences of our actions won't be clear to all until the distant future. But we need a global consensus now. In this age of globalization, climate protection is a cross-cutting task for politics, business, science and society as a whole./////Climate change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and social development of whole continents and indeed of the entire international community. Climate policy issues therefore form a major part of our foreign policy which is aimed at achieving and maintaining peace and security./////With each year that passes it will become more difficult and expensive to resolve the climate issue, and its impact will be more dramatic. We still have time to limit global warming to 2°C./////We must reverse the global trend of constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions by 2020./////Time is short. The window of opportunity for joint global solutions is closing. But this must not be an excuse for us to give up our ambitious goals, which remain necessary and achiev­able./////Unchecked climate change jeopardizes respect for fundamental human rights. It particularly threatens one of the most basic human rights, that to life in a healthy environment./////Especially in those countries that have done the least to cause global warming, the very exist­ence of millions is in danger./////The fight against climate change is also an opportunity, however. We have the chance to create the framework for sustainable, qualitative growth at global level./////It is not about giving up the idea of growth. Those who do not aim for growth will not become prosperous. It's a question of qualitative growth which is sustainable, resource-friendly and which contributes to climate protection./////That is a huge challenge, but above all it is a great opportunity. At global level a modern industry can be established which produces in an environment-friendly way, enables growth and innovation, and creates jobs. Education and innovation are the primary factors here./////For that reason, too, the Federal Government, soon after taking office, decided to invest an additional 12 billion euro in education and research./////I personally see a broad area for cooperation to our mutual benefit in the field of environment and climate protection, energy and infrastructure. This especially applies to the promotion of new technologies. Germany will be happy to make a contribution with its expertise in the renewable energies and energy efficiency sector./////As foreign minister the theme of climate and security is of special concern to me, as climate change can lead to internal instability in countries and regions and have a dramatic impact on relations between peoples./////We are already seeing changes in the way people live in many parts of the world due to global warming. We must assume that climate change will bring rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions and droughts. The consequences are clear-food and water shortages, disease, rural depopulation and migration./////For some countries this threat is directly tangible./////My recent talks with the President of Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, greatly moved me. He vividly drove home the danger facing the small island states due to global warming-today their very existence is threatened./////To simply accept or ignore this is not an option for us!/////We will use all the foreign-policy tools at our disposal with regard to climate change: clas­sical diplomacy, development policy, international education policy and the promotion of innovation and high tech./////Climate protection has become one of the major policy issues worldwide, also in the foreign-policy field. Climate protection and the promotion of new technologies feature in almost all my visits abroad. Whether in China, Japan, Brazil, South Africa or Tanzania, all are aware how urgent the problem is./////But we must still agree on how to jointly achieve our objective. It will not be easy, but there is no alternative. We can bring our experiences from classical foreign policy into that process./////Hans-Dietrich Genscher once put forward three options for the multipolar world he saw on the horizon://///The first is a world without rules, sanctions or responsibility. This he called the chaos option./////The second is a world in which individual states can set the global rules due to their economic or military strength. This is a dangerous option./////The third option is global cooperation based on equal rights and status for all nations, states and regions. That is the cooperation option./////Chaos is not an option, nor is rule by individual states or regions, if a global consensus has to be brought about. The name Petersberg stands for the third, the cooperation option, cooper­ation based on equal rights and status for all nations./////The cooperation option requires far sighted and responsible action, also at regional level. Only this option offers the prospect of sustainable, long-term success./////The cooperation option means more than just mutual consideration and an appeal to shared responsibility. It means harmonizing our values and interests. This is our common task./////Since the Second World War Europe has gathered experience of how to build mutual confi­dence in spite of fundamental differences./////Take the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe (CSCE), which played a major role in ending the Cold War. Through the CSCE and its successor, the OSCE, we have built up a great deal of mutual trust in Europe. In this way German reunification became possible and the division of our continent was overcome./////Today's world is facing a similar challenge. Europe wants to set the pace in achieving a global consensus on how to combat climate change./////",0.3
Sustainable development,    21.06.2010 - Speech,Opening speech by Minister of State Hoyer at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum 'Climate Change and the Media' - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__ check against delivery! __/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////We are gathered in a historical place today for the third Global Media Forum hosted by Deutsche Welle titled ""The Heat is on-Climate Change and the Media"". The plenary chamber of the former German Bundestag is located on the grounds where Germany found its way back to its democratic roots after 1945. For decades, this is where decisions that guided and shaped Germany were made./////This is where Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl presented his ten point plan in 1989, thereby laying the foundation for German unification. Just a year later, on the very day of unification, Federal President Richard von Weizsäcker made the following statement that many of us will always remember: ""We hope to serve world peace in a united Europe.""/////This statement is more relevant today than ever before. For the world has not become a more peaceful place. New challenges threaten our security. These challenges are usually global in nature and we can only address them together, globally. This is especially true when it comes to climate change, a phenomenon that affects all of us. Around the world. Though the effects vary greatly./////In order to effectively counter climate change, we have to look beyond the borders of our country and take an interdisciplinary approach. That is why I am particularly glad that Deutsche Welle, in cooperation with the Federal Foreign Office, has brought together media representatives from around the world, experts from international organizations and govern­ment agencies, as well as politicians, artists, entrepreneurs and academics for this year's Global Media Forum./////Deutsche Welle has recognized that a topic like climate change requires networked thinking on a global level. As the seat of the UNFCCC secretariat, Bonn is the ideal place for doing this. We want to promote and further develop Bonn as a UN location. This is an expression of our international engagement. We have to work together to fight climate change and create a spirit of solidarity, as we have in other fields./////Though the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit was unsatisfactory, closer interna­tional cooperation is the only viable course. If we continue to work together-I'm already looking ahead to the next climate summit at the end of the year in Cancun-we can succeed in finding common solutions. On climate issues, there is no alternative to the UN process./////Over the next few days you will focus on climate change and the media. If you think about it, climate change has everything a story needs to make headlines around the world-everyone has heard of it and has an opinion on it. It is discussed extensively and emotionally, it directly influences many people's lives and can further escalate existing conflicts or even cause new ones. If it were a celebrity, climate change would have no problem keeping fans on their toes. Yet despite the relevance and urgency of climate change, it is a topic that inspires the same feeling among all media consumers and journalists: we hear about this all the time, we've done countless stories on this. Does this topic offer us anything that is new or newsworthy?/////In a media world where competition for high circulation and the best ratings is becoming increasingly tough, climate change will encounter ever greater difficulties finding its way into newspapers, news magazines and talk shows. On the one hand it is a topic of only latent rele­vance, but on the other hand its problems are becoming ever more pressing./////Extreme weather, crop failure and famine-changes in the climate already portend disastrous consequences for millions of people around the world. North and south will be equally affected, yet particularly the world's island states. For some countries this threat is already tangible. Their very existence is in acute danger, and with it an important human right: the right to live in a healthy environment./////These countries are rightly counting on assistance from the international community. To simply accept or ignore this situation is not an option for us! Globalization also means a global, universal neighbourhood. Events in other regions of the world affect us more directly today than ever before. There are no longer any remote areas or incidents. The fight against climate change is therefore one of the central issues of the 21st century./////Climate change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and social development of every continent and its nations. It can cause instability in states and regions and be harmful to the peaceful coexistence of different populations. That is why climate protection is not just a topic for specialists. Climate issues, or to put it more precisely, international climate issues are an important part of our foreign policy which is aimed at achieving and maintaining peace and security./////German climate policy has brought new ideas to the international arena. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which was held at the beginning of May, is one example. Together with Mexico, Germany invited around 50 environment ministers from all around the world to the Petersberg near Bonn. This intentionally informal conference achieved its goal: it strengthened the trust between negotiating partners that had been weakened in light of the disappointing results of the Copenhagen summit. This trust is essential to achieving substantial progress in the negotiations on a UN climate agreement./////The Petersberg Climate Dialogue also inspired new international initiatives. For example in rainforest protection, where Germany is making considerable financial resources available, or on international standards for reviewing and assessing climate protection measures. Here Germany, along with South Africa and South Korea, is willing to serve as a coordinator. Through its multi-faceted engagement, Germany shows that it is assuming responsibility for climate change./////In Central Asia, the Federal Foreign Office is making 22.5 million euro available to improve the water supply. Water is scarce and unevenly distributed in this region. The largely dried-up Aral Sea, once the fourth-largest lake in the world, is a dramatic symbol of this water shortage. Within the framework of the so-called Berlin Process, the Federal Foreign Office is now supporting the establishment of sustainable structures for cross-border water management. Networking is taking place among water experts from Germany, the EU and Central Asia and education opportunities in the field of water management are being created./////Since 2009 the German Government has provided concrete support for countries threatened by climate change through the International Climate Initiative, to which we devote 120 million euro annually. While other countries are still considering whether or not to provide financial assistance, we are already implementing it-with an innovative aid instru­ment that has received much international praise./////Because what's special about the International Climate Initiative is the way it is financed. The funds come directly from the returns on auctioning allowances within the EU's emissions trading system. In Germany, we put a price on greenhouse gas emissions that the polluter has to pay. And we use this financial compensation for climate protection./////Our country is known around the world for its environmentally-friendly technology and ideas and we are working to establish sustainable economic structures that reflect ecological as well as economic goals. Here Germany is an international leader. We are promoting renewable energy in Germany-this is guaranteed by law-and have made environmental protection a national goal that is firmly rooted in our constitution, the Basic Law./////The German Govern­ment has voluntarily committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2020. This is a goal that sends an international message, a goal that puts us at the forefront internationally, as well as within the EU./////German companies are also making a sustainable contribution to reviving the global economy that was weakened by the financial and economic crisis by investing in innovative technologies./////A stable climate along with sustainable, reliable and affordable energy are essential to the world's economies. A joint initiative aimed at investing in new, cleaner energy sources could create jobs, conserve the environment and protect the climate, improve living standards and increase global security./////All around the world initiatives and alliances aimed at curbing climate change have emerged. At the bilateral level as well, we are seeing increasingly intensive cooperation./////One example is the Transatlantic Climate Bridge, which since September 2008 has represented strengthened cooperation between Germany and the United States. Different projects bring together Germans and Americans who are working for climate protection. From journalists and farmers to businesses and universities, all participants are given a valuable opportunity to share their experience./////Making these developments visible to the broader public requires free and independent media. Reporting on climate change is a major challenge for journalists. On the one hand, the material is often highly scientific, complicated and controversial. On the other hand, it is often impossible to see the results of climate protection projects in the short term. Journalists have to ask themselves: which aspects of this topic are new and interesting? How can they be presented without resorting to cliches? And how can often abstract developments be explained in an accessible way?/////Here the media have a major responsibility. They can directly influence people's behaviour. For that reason, it is important that it is not just the spectacular natural disasters that make the news. Instead reporting needs to go deeper to shed light on the background and explain approaches to solving these problems. In this way, the media can help create transparency and make the political and scientific processes more accessible./////This requires media representatives around the world to have extensive background knowledge, creativity and commitment. That is why, above all, training for journalists is becoming more and more important. Even though many of them would like to bring this topic more into the spotlight, they often don't know how. This is where Deutsche Welle's training for international journalists, which receives financial support from the Federal Foreign Office, comes in./////Deutsche Welle's ""Akademie"" equips media representatives in many developing countries and emerging economies with the journalistic and technical skills to professionally portray political, cultural or economic topics. Bringing journalists from all over Central Asia together for a seminar on how to improve their online and radio programmes, for instance, or teaching radio editors from Guinea-Bissau how to produce accessible, understandable educational programmes is a step towards strengthening media around the world, thus making them more independent. Because media representatives who feel confident in their trade are better able to resist external intervention and influences. Moreover, audiences take them seriously and listen to them./////It is also necessary to mention the enormous potential social networks hold in this context. Social networks are an effective way to link people around the world-a decisive factor when dealing with a global topic like climate change. For young people in particular, the internet is increasingly becoming the main means of communication-in Germany alone, young people spend an average of over 100 minutes a day online./////As part of the social web, media have the opportunity to use existing structures to initiate discussions, gather ideas from their target audiences and effectively position their topics. Due to the constantly growing number of interactive opportunities, this field is becoming more and more interesting for the media./////And the media are already utilizing this potential. Evidence of this can also be seen on the Global Media Forum website. Conference participants can network with one another online, discuss the topic and stay in touch. Users can submit photos for an interactive world map that demon­strates climate change where they live./////I would like to invite all of you to actively participate in the virtual discussion-may today's conference be the start!/////This year's Global Media Forum would like to draw attention to the urgency of climate prob­lems and develop approaches to solving them. Only when experts from different fields come together, as they have here, can we develop and implement responses./////That is why the Federal Foreign Office is once again happy to support this conference, as it has in past years. I hope you will meet many interesting new people and have intensive discussions over the next three days. I am sure that together we will find ways to solidly establish climate change as a topic in the media./////Climate change has the potential to make headlines-even without the disasters!/////",0.3
Sustainable development,    21.01.2011 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle in the German Bundestag on the occasion of the first reading of the draft mandate for extending Germany's participation in ISAF in Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Mr President! Ladies and gentlemen!/////It is not by chance that today's debate on Afghanistan and the situation in the country began with a policy statement by Dirk Niebel, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. This clearly shows that we must give prominence not only to the military service that our men and women of the Bundeswehr are performing there. Since so many service members are present here today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you and to your comrades, on behalf of this House, for everything you are doing in Afghanistan./////Of course we also know-and the servicemen and women are especially aware of this-that we will not succeed in Afghanistan if we place all our faith in a military solution. Our military commitment serves to bolster stability in Afghanistan. The visible progress that has been made on civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan is highly remarkable. No other German Government has been engaged in civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan to the extent the current Government has. No other German Government has done as much for building up and training Afghan security forces as the current Government has. May I ask you to take this into account when criticizing us. The situation was different when you were in power./////However, civilian reconstruction and safeguarding these achievements with a view to the country's stability can of course only be part of the solution. The political solution is what matters most. This realization is at the heart of the shift in strategy that took place almost exactly one year ago at the London Conference on Afghanistan. At the time, this strategy shift was highly controversial, also in this House. But it is becoming clear that what the German Government negotiated in London together with its partners was right. We will not achieve peace in Afghanistan by military means, but only through a political solution. Our international engagement therefore aims to bring about a political solution, with a view to creating sustainable and lasting stability in Afghanistan-so that also once our engagement has ended, the country will not again become a safe haven and refuge for international terrorism./////It is key to this political process that all actors be involved. It is paramount that we are ever more successful in our efforts towards regional involvement, that is to say involving affected neighbouring countries. A start was made in London with the Conference on Afghanistan. Subsequently, for the first time, a conference on Afghanistan-attended by all actors-was held in Kabul, that is, in the country itself. Participants included, one should note, those neighbouring countries that have not taken part in the process for years. At this conference, agreements were also reached between Afghanistan and Pakistan. From a Central European vantage point, such trade agreements would appear easy to conclude. Yet anyone with background knowledge about relations between the two countries knows that these agreements represent a huge step forward. Regarding Iran, there are many questions-I am thinking, for example, of those relating to the drug trafficking-that can only be answered by involving neighbouring countries and through relevant networking. All of this happened./////Late last year, NATO held its summit in Lisbon. It was a true milestone. I would like to again mention the four dates-not just three-of our road map, of our strategy for the future://///First, during the first half of this year, we want to begin transferring responsibility for local security in the districts and provinces./////Second, we are confident that, by the end of the year, we will be able to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time./////Third, by the end of 2014 we should have succeeded in completely transferring responsibility for local security to the Afghans. This is not only our aim, it is also the express aim of the Afghan Government that there will no longer be any of our combat troops in the country./////The fourth point is often forgotten. Also beyond 2014, Germany must remain actively committed to sustainable security in Afghanistan. Were we not to do so, the Taliban would immediately regain the upper hand. They would again sow the seeds of terrorism throughout the world, and all efforts, also those of our Bundeswehr men and women, would have been in vain. We would be back to square one. There must be no second vacuum left behind in Afghanistan. This is what we believe is at stake./////In the policy statement I delivered in December 2010, I commented on this in detail. Contrary to everything that has been insinuated in this connection, it is totally clear that every road map is always contingent on the situation actually turning out as foreseen. By the way, this has not only been included in the text of the mandate for the first time, but is word for word what I said in my policy statement on behalf of the German Government in December./////In other words: by the end of 2011, we want to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time. Yet it is self-understood that, for all of this, the following conditions must be met: only if the situation permits, and only if our servicemen and women on the ground are not endangered. Because what we want is an irreversible and sustainable process of transfer of responsibility. This is the objective.///// (_)/////The German Government is confident that, as security responsibility is progressively handed over, the presence of Bundeswehr forces can be reduced, starting at the end of 2011. The German Government will use all of the leverage that is justifiable in terms of security policy to draw down forces as early as possible-if the situation permits, and provided that neither our service members nor the sustainability of the transition process are put at risk./////On this point, one does not have to be a military expert. Simple common sense will tell you this is the rational way forward. And that is what matters in the end./////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, our colleague Mr Omid Nouripour (The Greens) would like to ask you a question./////Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle://///Please, go ahead./////Omid Nouripour (Alliance 90/The Greens)://///Mr Minister, you have just said that, if possible and if the security situation permits, the presence of German servicemen and women in Afghanistan is to be reduced by the end of this year. I have the following question: Are you excluding the possibility that the mandate ceiling could in the meantime be raised due to the employment of AWACS planes, or that some of the flexible reserve personnel may be brought in?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///On this issue, I share the position of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and I suggest you take a close look at it./////Generally speaking, travelling seems to purify the mind-because SPD Chairman Sigmar Gabriel in an interview today said that these are two separate matters. Germany has declared that, for the time being, we are not participating in the AWACS operation, since we are focusing on basic and further training. Apart from this, we naturally discuss and reassess everything with our Allies at regular intervals. Therefore, the question of whether I would exclude anything may be useful for political bickering between parties, but it is totally inappropriate as regards substance-considering that, in an alliance, we can only succeed together. This question is totally inappropriate!/////I am telling you this, dear colleague, because I believe you really could learn a thing or two from the larger opposition party, the SPD./////These days, the Social Democratic Party is struggling to find a position, holding discussions, and weighing the arguments, and it has publicly stated in response to the Federal Government's request that it will not abandon our men and women in uniform, and that it wants to support them./////Your party is completely different. No foreign minister sent as many service members into missions abroad as The Greens' foreign minister-but your memory grew clouded as soon as you switched to the opposition./////What you are doing is irresponsible-I repeat, irresponsible!/////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, would you reply to a question by our colleague Mr Stefan Liebich (The Left)?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///Yes./////Stefan Liebich (The Left)://///Mr Foreign Minister, you have just read some passages from the text that we will be voting on, but not from the section that is up for vote. Can you confirm that the condition the SPD has made a prerequisite for its consent is not even met in the Federal Government's motion, and that what you have read here, along with every figure indicating a withdrawal, is merely mentioned in the explanatory part of the motion?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///I will give you a short reply-although you have been a member of the German Bundestag not for a few weeks, but for a few months already./////With all due respect, dear colleague, you should know that it is standard practice for us to submit a text, for which the explanatory part of course forms the political context. Are you seriously suggesting that the German Bundestag resolve that the German Government is confident? I think the German Bundestag should be more self-assured here. The armed forces operate under a parliamentary mandate, not a government one. That is why the German Bundestag has the final say. Anything else would be surreal./////It will then be our task to make every effort to move forward this year the process that we will hopefully unanimously, or at any rate by a large majority, agree in this House. Last year, three important milestones were set along the path towards the political solution we seek: London, Kabul, and the conference in Lisbon. This year will see another important milestone right here in Germany, namely the Conference on Afghanistan in Bonn. I predict that this conference, scheduled for the end of the year, will focus on the high-stake issues: a political solution, reintegration, including reconciliation, and dialogue. This Afghanistan conference must however also concentrate on the time following 2014. This was where I left off before the questions were asked./////Dear colleagues, anyone who now conveys the impression in Afghanistan that, as of 2014, people will be left in the lurch-because we don't care about them any longer, they can do what they want and should handle things on their own-he or she will only find that no progress will be made on good governance or on the fight against drug trafficking and corruption, or on democratic development, which is our common objective. We would thereby risk the partners we need for building up the country on a secure and permanent basis turning their backs on us-due to fear for their own, and their families', lives./////This would not be responsible policy; what we want is a responsible handover of responsibility. Something that has been jointly decided in the German Bundestag must be completed in a responsible way. And you must not disappoint the friends you need to enhance security also here in Germany, given the threat of terrorism./////As a member of the United Nations Security Council, we have taken on a coordinating role as regards Afghanistan. I will therefore address the German Bundestag on a regular basis on this topic. I assume that we will also hold regular discussions in the committees. I can assure you that I will keep you, that is your spokespeople and representatives, informed on progress whenever possible. You have probably noticed that I have done so in recent months, and this practice will be continued. In my opinion, a broad majority in the German Bundestag is not so much a political issue, but rather would stand for clear support for the men and women in the Bundeswehr, who are risking their lives in Afghanistan for our freedom and security./////Such a broad majority is also of importance for our international partners, and for our Allies-so they can rest assured that there is broad political support./////Politicians must be prepared to shoulder responsibility, even if this costs them some opinion poll percentage points./////What is most important is the security, freedom, and future of our country and of Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen of the opposition, and of The Greens: you should follow the example of the Social Democrats. These words coming from me should give you pause for thought./////Thank you./////",0.2
Sustainable development,    26.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the fourth Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe 2010 in Hamburg on 26 November 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanve text __//////////General Secretary Ma,/////Commissioner Almunia,/////Mayor Ahlhaus,/////Excellencies,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce and the China Federation of Industrial Economics for their invitation and for organizing this important conference./////The Chinese and German economies are doing well. This year, China is set to grow by nearly ten percent. Even during the crisis, Chinese growth was robust./////This growth has now also reached the rural parts of the country, allowing more and more people in China to enjoy the benefits. We appreciate very much that China has lifted millions out of poverty./////As a major exporter, Germany has also benefited from China's growth. Our exports to China were even growing in the years of the crisis./////This year, we expect the German economy to grow by 3.4 percent. Unlike in previous years, this growth is due not only to our strong exports but also to increasing domestic demand. The German Government attaches great importance to encouraging this development. Our country is doing better today than it was a year ago./////This is not just good news for the people of Germany. In closely interconnected national economies we each benefit from the other's growth./////We have a volume of bilateral trade of more than 90 billion euro. Germany is China's most important trading partner in the EU. And China is Germany's most important trading partner in Asia./////China and Germany, two export nations, depend particularly on networks, open markets and free trade. This is particularly true when it comes to raw materials. Last month, the federal government adopted a new raw materials strategy. We will work for a fair and sustainable use of these materials. In a globalized world with its international division of labour, free trade in raw materials is a great asset. Access to raw materials should be made fair and reliable. China would act in its own economic interests if China reconsidered its decisions on export restrictions./////China and Germany share an interest in a fair and stable system of world trade, and we should continue to work on that together./////The world economy benefits from open markets, in Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere./////That is why I strongly support all efforts to conclude free trade agreements beetween the EU and partners in Asia. We need strong exchange between strong partners. Large long-term current-account imbalances ought to be redressed as well as possible. I believe we all agree on this. However, we cannot focus on only one indicator. Competitiveness must not be penalized, but encouraged./////China and Germany are connected by a strategic partnership. In 2011, our governments will hold our first comprehensive consultations. For all our differences, we cooperate in many ways, to our mutual benefit./////More cooperation should also be the basis of the EU's new strategy towards China. I will continue my efforts to help shaping the relationship between China and the EU./////Today, China's rise has an impact on almost all of Europe's global interests./////Preserving our prosperity, free world trade, climate protection, the universality of human rights, security interests in Africa and the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Iran./////Given its size, its economic and political standing, China is a key partner for the EU in the 21st century./////As China's importance in the international community grows, the country's responsibility for international security grows as well./////Only a year ago but a few would have expected the international community to agree on a common position on Iran. But we have succeeded. Thanks to the circumspection shown by those involved. Through consultations we were able to agree with Russia and China on a common position in the security council./////The international community cannot accept Iran holding nuclear weapons. We welcome the Chinese contribution towards this unified position./////We need China as an actor for global peace. This is especially true with regard to the dangerous provocation by North Korea. We are very concerned about the recent incidents on the South Korean island. We strongly condemn the North-Korean attacks on the island of Yeonpyeong. We asked China to use its influence to contribute to a de-escalation of the situation./////As an economic heavyweight, China shares responsibility to the global economy as a whole. We therefore welcome the fact that China will assume an even more important role in the International Monetary Fund following IMF reform./////China is an active member of the G20. The country is in close contact with the G8. The exchange rates between the world currencies are just one of the issues which we debate in these groups./////Iwelcome that China is allowing a gradual appreciation of its currency. We encourage China to take further steps in the same direction. It is in the interests of both the country itself and its partners in trade that the exchange rate properly reflects the strength of a country's economy./////China and the European Union are closely linked by direct investment. Chinese investors are very welcome in the European Union, as they are in Germany. We know what they contribute to economic growth and the protection of jobs here. In this great harbour city of Hamburg this can be witnessed every day./////Iwelcome very much Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's tribute to European companies doing business in the country. He said that foreign enterprises registered in China are Chinese enterprises. It is important that EU enterprises making products and paying taxes in China receive the same legal treatment as Chinese companies./////Chinese companies enjoy equal treatment in the EU. We needs to same the for EU companies, whether in awarding public contracts, in labour law or any other area./////We acknowledge China's progress in the protection of intellectual property./////Many innovative Chinese companies have accumulated intellectual property very much worth protecting. I am convinced that this protection is essential for a creative and innovative environment./////The rule of law and the right to take legal action are very important for foreign investment. China has undertaken great efforts in the last several years to reform its legal system. The rule of law is the basis of political reform, which your Government has recognized as essential. I wish you courage and strength when you continue on this path./////The German Government supports China in this process through our intensive rule of law dialogue. Together with our human rights dialogue, this builds a solid foundation for a real partnership. Values and interests are not opposites, we need them both as pillars of our foreign policy./////When it comes to the big global issues, China and the European Union should work closely together. You all know the challenges involved and have been discussing them in great depth over the last few days./////No one denies any longer that climate change affects us all. Climate policy is a task for the entire international community. In the long term, we want to set targets that are binding under international law. The European Union is all set to work with China on this constructive cooperation. My recent talks with the Chinese foreign minister confirmed that the Chinese government wants to tackle climate change as a matter of urgency./////Together, we need to make progress at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun./////Climate protection is compatible with economic growth. Anyone who is serious about combating climate change is going to need innovation and new technology. During Chancellor Angela Merkel's last visit to Beijing, she and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao agreed a very concrete agenda to tackle this issue. Companies from Germany and the EU have a lot of both to offer./////They have a strong interest in supporting China on its road towards becoming a low-carbon economy./////The economy is not everything, but without the economy, nothing else can work. Who would know this better than all of you./////The German Government attaches great importance to the cultural exchange between China and Europe, between China and Germany. We seek to know each other even better and learn from each other./////I thank all the companies and the city of Hamburg for their committed work in our festival ""Germany and China-Moving Ahead Together"". With a focus on sustainable urbanization, this series of events was far more than the traditional cultural year. I also extend my thanks to everyone who worked on our success at the Expo in Shanghai./////More than four million visitors showed great interest in our country./////Next spring, the National Museum of China's new premises in Beijing will open with an exhibition called ""The Art of Enlightenment"". And we also look forward to the year of Chinese culture in Germany in 2012./////Political action is far more than what governments do. Personal friendships, joint research projects and strong economic relations all contribute to mutual understanding and trust. In this light, let me express my gratitude to the organizers of this fourth Hamburg Summit./////I wish everyone here all the very best personally. And since my party membership is no secret I probably do not surprise you when I wish you all success in business as well./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
Sustainable development,    29.03.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Federal Minister Westerwelle at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 29 March 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __//////////Lieber Herr Breitschwerdt,/////Ihnen und den Mitgliedern der deutsch-kanadischen Handelskammer ganz herzlichen Dank fr die Einladung zu diesem Festakt.//////////Minister Pupatello, Minister Van Loan,/////President Naylor,/////It is a real honour and pleasure to be here with you. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today at this eminent University, in this dynamic city, in this huge province and beautiful country./////Canada is known worldwide as a tolerant and open-minded country. As host of the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games Canada was the focus for all sports fans around the world. Let me thank Canada for such wonderful Games. Once more Canada has lived up to its high reputation and presented itself as a wonderful host. And I am happy to congratulate Canada on its first position in the medal table. By the way, Germany came in second./////Ladies and Gentlemen,/////In purely geographical terms Canada and Germany are far apart. But when it comes to our values and our interests Canada and Germany are very close. Our two countries share the same fundamental values. These include democracy and the rule of law, the need for international cooperation and the primacy of international law. We share a similar understanding of the value of individual freedom. All of these values bind us together./////To defend these common values Canadian Forces were based in Germany for four decades. From 1954 to 1994 Canadian men and women helped us to confront Communism along the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. More than 400.000 Canadians lived in Germany to protect our shared free and democratic ideals. We thank you for your staunch support and your strong friendship./////And it was here in Canada, in Ottawa, at the Open Skies Conference in 1990, that the process of negotiating the Two plus Four Agreement was started. This year we celebrate with gratitude the 20th anniversary of German Unification./////That you had an event here to commemorate the beginning of the Two plus Four process is something I really appreciate./////Let me assure you: The German people will not forget the part Canada played in bringing down the Berlin Wall and in the unification of our country. Some people speak of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, but the Wall did not fall, people brought it down. We will always be very grateful to Canada./////German foreign policy is value-based and interest-led. That is not a contradiction but the two sides of the same coin. The German-Canadian relationship reflects this combination in a unique manner. Our relationship is not only based on shared values, but also on shared interests./////Both our countries are major economic powers, both are heavily dependent on exports. More than many other countries Germany and Canada have to be concerned about the lurking dangers of protectionism. All countries profit from free trade. But more than elsewhere our prosperity is a result of free access to foreign markets./////Both of us face competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Our two countries cannot-and don't want to-compete on salaries or social and environmental standards with those countries. The cheaper the products from those countries, the better and more advanced our products have to be. More than many other countries Canada and Germany have to stay at the forefront of research and development to maintain prosperity./////This year we celebrate one hundred years of Canadian-German trade relations./////Today our bilateral annual trade volume adds up to more than 10 billion Euros. The EU is Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. Canadian-German trade relations are a success story. But there is still potential for further growth./////As Minister for Foreign Affairs I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal. Soon after taking office I saw to it that strategies were developed with the aim of enhancing Germany's external economic policy. We want to open up external economic promotion to other sectors and make it more attractive to small and medium__ized companies in particular. These form the backbone of the German economy. Let me assure you: I will pursue external economic promotion not with timidity but with vigor. In other words, I will do it the Canadian way. It is no accident that your foreign ministry is called ""Department for Foreign Affairs and International Trade""./////In a globalized world it is not enough for countries like Canada and Germany just to expand their trade volume. We have to deepen our trade relations./////That is why in 2007, when Germany held the Presidency of the European Union, we lobbied hard to get the EU to work with Canada on a ""Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"". Both sides have been doing their homework. Formal discussions have begun and are going well. They take us into new territory for our bilateral relations. To meet the goals we have set, we have to look at investment rules; at provincial as well as federal government procurement; at regulations; at intellectual property rights; at local competition policies; at labour and environment issues. We may not be able to agree on everything but a substantial agreement will not only be a major boost to Canadian-European trade, but also to the German and Canadian position on the global market./////Both our countries will only be able to keep their positions at the forefront of prosperous states if we make sure that we maintain our position at the high end of the value chain./////To do that, we have to invest heavily in education, in innovation, in science and in research and in development. The answer is to use our advantages, to bring out the very best that we can offer to the world. And, more and more, that is something we do in partnership with other countries./////Just one example: Research in Motion and their latest Blackberry: They came up with a keyboard that is very small and still easy to use because every single letter is cleverly and differently shaped. That was invented at RIM's new facility in Bochum, Germany./////And there are many other similar examples./////By combining the best of research and science in many countries we stay competitive in a globalized world. In that respect, Germany, the EU and Canada have a lot to offer each other./////Education is the number one priority in both our countries. The new German government will invest an extra 12 billion Euro in education, research and development. But improving educational institutions is not only a question of money. It is also a question of structures./////Business schools have long talked about ""best practices"". Learning from each other about what works and what does not./////One very good example of ""best practices"" is the award given in 2008 by the Bertelsmann Foundation, one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany, to the Toronto District School Board for its work in providing fair and equal opportunities for all children. At the awards ceremony, the Foundation said: ""The school system in Toronto shows us what actions we have to take, considering the challenges we are facing from globalization, migration and demographic change"". Using the experience of Toronto, the Foundation has launched its own programme in Germany called ""Integration Through Education""./////I think this is the way forward. As the challenges we face grow more complex, we all profit from looking for solutions also beyond our borders./////The global economic and financial crisis has not led to a slowing down or halt in the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely because of a lack of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must prevent global problems from turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops on the basis of a set of rules and values. Let me underline this: Our shared goal must be to give globalization a set of rules and values so that peace, security and prosperity are safeguarded in the long term./////Here we see Canada as a natural partner, because we share the same fundamental values and interests./////As I am travelling to the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today, let me point out just two topics Canada and Germany are dealing with side by side right now at the global level://///Both Germany and Canada have a strong interest in nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. As countries that do not possess nuclear weapons we want to contribute to strengthening the international regime against the proliferation of nuclear weapons while making nuclear technology available for peaceful uses. I am therefore pleased that the Canadian G8 Presidency has made non-proliferation a priority issue at our meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today and tomorrow./////A related and very important issue at the G8 meeting will be the nuclear dispute with Iran. We are very concerned about Iran's unwillingness and inability to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. I would like to underline that we are not against Iran using nuclear power for the peaceful production of energy. We have offered a generous package of assistance in exchange for assurances. But the Iranian leadership should understand that we cannot and will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. It would constitute a major threat to regional stability but it would also undermine the global non-proliferation regime. Our hand to Iran remains outstretched. But in the absence of a response and real progress the international community has to prepare stronger sanctions against Iran. We will discuss the situation and the way forward at our meeting tomorrow./////Canada and Germany are long term partners, on the bilateral and the global level./////We may be on two different continents but on the major challenges of our time we stand as one./////Over the last century our relations have been deepened, improved and strengthened. I am very optimistic that we will continue in that direction in the future. Not only because our governments agree upon many topics, but because of the deep friendship between our peoples./////Thank you very much./////",0.1
Sustainable development,    04.06.2010 - Speech,Opening address by Minister of State Werner Hoyer at the meeting of the Friends of Yemen working group - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Dear Co-Chair, dear Khaled Al Ghaith,dear Mohy Abdullah Al Dhabbi,Excellencies,dear Colleagues, dear Friends,/////It gives me great pleasure to welcome all of you here in Berlin at the second meeting of the Working Group on Economy and Governance of the Friends of Yemen. The challenges this Working Group has been asked to address are formidable ones./////For me and for my country, Germany, it is an honour and a privilege to host and to co-chair this meeting together with our Emirati partners, in close collaboration with our friends from Yemen, and building on the active participation and contributions of an impressively large number of countries and organisations gathered around this table today./////All of you are well aware of that./////Yemen faces a serious risk of destabilization./////If not properly addressed, several stress factors can easily impact negatively on the prospects of development for the country and also have consequences beyond the borders of Yemen://///Yemen is facing severe interior conflicts, up to the point of threatening the unity and integrity of the country. The armed conflict with the Houthi rebels in the North was put on hold with a truce in February this year. This was an achievement which was greeted by all of us. But the root causes of the conflict remain to be addressed. Yet, on another front, a separatist movement in the South is rallying support. This is a threat which we have to take seriously. Again, healing the rifts between North and South will only come if there is an opportunity to tackle the root causes of the divide. As a German politician, I am fully aware of the challenges of what we have labelled the necessity to accomplish the unity of a country after unification./////An increasingly deteriorating economic situation is another area of serious concern. With dwindling revenues from the oil economy, the Government lacks more and more the funds it needs to ensure fulfilment of its basic functions for the people. Changes towards a more sustainable and broader economic basis are desperately needed. Yemen is one of the poorest nations in the Arab world. Much of the population lives on less than a few dollars a day. With unemployment widening and the population growing, today's perspectives for making a living tomorrow are slim. Yemen therefore knows it needs to invest in education and job opportunities to give its people a perspective for the future./////In view of this situation, the ""Friends of Yemen"" have gathered in London early this year in order to try to address the challenges in a joint effort./////Allow me to take the opportunity to briefly share with you my personal reading of what the ""Friends of Yemen"" process is about./////The starting point of the ""Friends of Yemen"" is the understanding that the challenges Yemen is facing are challenges to all of us - to Yemen and its people first and foremost, but also to the Region, in particular to the neighbouring countries, the countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and also to the International Community in general./////Stabilizing Yemen, so the core message, is primarily about Yemen and the Yemeni people. But it is also about preventing the spread of instability and its negative impact into the region and beyond the region./////""Friends of Yemen"" is not about money. It is not yet another donor conference. It is mainly about generating political commitment in Yemen and outside Yemen to address and to try to resolve the most pressing issues in a joint effort./////""Friends of Yemen"" have based their work on a common understanding of a couple of guiding principles./////First, Yemeni ownership and Yemeni responsibility. Yemen is in the drivers seat for its own reform agenda. International partners stand ready to encourage, advise and support, but should by no means attempt to impose a foreign agenda of whatever kind or nature. It is Yemen, its leadership and ultimately its people who have to grasp the opportunities offered in that process for more stability, prosperity and legitimacy. International support will have to build on and to rely on progress in implementing reform by Yemenis within Yemen./////That means on the other hand that the ""Friends of Yemen"" process will go nowhere unless there is a firm commitment by the Yemeni leadership to implement necessary reforms, even in the face of possible popular rejection./////Whoever carries the burden of political responsibility in times of crisis knows how tough the choices can become eventually./////Even in wealthy Europe, the effort of stabilizing ailing economies within the Eurozone comes with the implementation of reform, occasionally with austerity measures which are all but popular with the electorate and which require political courage and determination for those who bear responsibility in the political arena./////Allow me to point out in this context that we heard with a certain degree of concern the news that the recent round of consultations between Yemen and the IMF has apparently not produced an agreement on how to proceed with regard to a possible IMF programme for Yemen. As you all know, such a programme has already been identified in London as being of particular importance. Let me express my hope that Yemen and the IMF will continue their efforts to come to terms in order to conclude an agreement on a possible programme./////Second, regional cooperation and integration. We all acknowledge the paramount importance of the direct neighbours of Yemen with regard to the stabilization efforts. ""Friends of Yemen"" have from the start reserved a very special role for the regional actors, mainly for the neighbours of Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Their perceptions, their recommendations, their contributions are of critical relevance for the success of the process./////I would also like to add a very personal remark, at the risk of being accused of continuing to foster a hopelessly romantic and eurocentristic world view: For me as a politician, whose home base has been Europe and the political project of European integration, I firmly believe in the beneficial effects of closer regional integration for peace and prosperity of those involved. Europe is a very telling example that in politics, the logic of zero-sum-games is certainly not the most fruitful perspective at hand. Far-sighted politicians in Europe understood the message of two World Wars which started on the European Continent: That less can become more, that integrating, giving up on the right to exercise sovereign decisions can become the most prominent avenue to peace and to prosperity./////It is also against this background that we support the Yemeni quest for closer regional integration and that we are heartened by the efforts of the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council to identify sectors and areas where integration of Yemen into GCC structures can be reinforced. We would like to encourage you to continue to explore this avenue further./////Third, the support of the International Community./////""Friends of Yemen"" are, not to a lesser extent, the ""Friends of Yemen"" within the international community. In our much too often media-driven political agendas, intricate challenges like the ones we are facing in Yemen, are in danger to be overlooked. They are simply too complex for simple narratives or for quick fixes. ""Friends of Yemen"" is in my view also about mobilizing political attention and political commitment for the political, economic, social and governance challenges Yemen is facing within the international community./////The Working Methods this Working Group has given itself tell a story worth noting: Partners and Friends have agreed to join hands, to join forces and to contribute, each one in the field of their foremost expertise, to a process shared by all./////Allow me to express my sincere gratitude and the gratitude of my government, and I am confident to speak also on behalf on my co-chair, the UAE, for the readiness of the participants of this Working Group to make significant contributions to the work of the Group./////In this spirit of a joint endeavour and a shared responsibility, I wish you fruitful exchanges. We all need a successful outcome of your deliberations./////",0.2
Africa development,    30.11.2010 - Speech,"Address by Foreign Minister Westerwelle at the third EU-Africa Summit on 30 November 2010 in Tripoli, Libya - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advanced text __//////////President of the European Council van Rompuy,Colonel Qadhafi,Deputy Chairwoman of the AU,Chairman of the AU Commission Jean Ping,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,//////////I don't want to downplay the major challenges that Africa faces. But what I see above all in Africa are major opportunities. We Europeans want to be equal partners, we want to meet on equal political and economic footing./////The question of how the EU and Africa can provide for more security and peace together is essential to our joint discussion of investment, economic growth and jobs. Prosperity is generated only in security, and lasting security only in a country under the rule of law which protects human rights./////We are all united by the goal of a security structure in Africa which can find African solutions to African problems. Peace and prosperity in Africa are also in the interest of Europe./////I would like to address here three of the many challenges the continent confronts: the Sudan, Somalia and piracy./////A peaceful referendum in the Sudan with fair results would bring increased stability to the whole region. We stand by the Sudan at this defining moment and we shall continue to do so after the referendum. Should the referendum bring about a South Sudanese state, the governments in both the north and the south will need a great deal of support in building up effective structures. Germany is ready to help./////In Somalia we have combined humanitarian aid with assistance in political reconstruction. Both bilaterally and in the EU, Germany supports the transitional government and the African Union Mission in Somalia. Of course, we cannot redress the consequences of a collapsed state on our own through EU missions to train Somali security forces or through our support for the rebuilding of the justice system. Peace can only succeed if the conflicting parties within Somalia make a serious effort to reach a peaceful solution. Because only a fair and stable social order can prevent instability and violence, we will use our networked approach to support Somalia on its path towards internal reconciliation./////The protection of humanitarian aid for Somalia is also our foremost aim in combating piracy off the coast of Somalia. Piracy threatens the women, men and children not only of Somalia, but of all of eastern Africa. It is in the shared interest of Africa and the EU for trade to remain possible in the region. Warships can only be a small part of a comprehensive solution. What the people of Somalia need first and foremost are prospects for the future./////The example of piracy shows the increase in global challenges in which Africa's interests run parallel to those of the EU. Such challenges-from piracy to fair development, from protecting human rights to combating climate change-require patience. But we must not waste any time. Ignoring problems does not make them go away./////We as the EU can achieve a great deal by working together with the AU and other regional organizations. Worldwide problems must be tackled within the United Nations. We will always be there to listen to your concerns and to support your goals in every way possible./////The Security Council cannot neglect the changes that have occurred in the past 65 years. The growing influence of Africa must be reflected in the composition of the Security Council./////Germany has supported the African Union in many ways in the past. The building of the headquarters for the AU Department of Peace and Security is only one example here. We will continue to support you.//////////",0.2
Africa development,    06.10.2010 - Speech,Address by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the presentation of the German Africa Award by the German Africa Foundation - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __//////////Dr Chambas,Professor Hornhues,Dr Eid,Dr Kohler,Professor Driftmann,Ms Schaeffer,Ms Diallo,Excellencies,Ladies and gentlemen,//////////Fifty years ago the world gazed spellbound toward Africa. In 1960, the Year of Africa, no less than 17 countries gained independence. 2010 has in its own way also become a Year of Africa./////South Africa seized the FIFA World Cup as an opportunity for the continent as a whole. This global event single-handedly swept away decades' worth of stereotypes./////Germany had a very similar experience four years earlier./////Everyone in this room knows that Africa is much more than poverty, crisis and disaster. Beyond the walls of this room, however, the fact that many economies in Africa are growing just as fast as in Asia is often still overlooked, as is the fact that an increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location, that a new middle class is gradually emerging there. There is good reason why countries such as China are now more present than ever in Africa./////Despite all the challenges, what I see above all when I look at Africa today are major opportunities and untapped potential-economic and political./////African political leaders are taking the continent's fate ever more into their own hands. Regional cooperation is on the rise. The clout of African regional organizations is growing. The principle of ownership is impacting behaviour./////We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper./////We cannot solve the world's most pressing problems without our neighbouring continent Africa./////We need a common response to climate change and its consequences, to development and food security issues, and to the challenges posed by rapidly growing or aging populations./////The time has come for a new turn towards partnership in our Africa policy. Away from a donor-recipient outlook. Towards a global responsibility partnership on equal footing./////The German Government will soon present a comprehensive concept for Africa, which takes into account Africa's changed self-perception as well as our own interests./////We see many young faces in the crowd gathered here today. These are the faces of the graduates of the Federal Foreign Office's first Training for International Diplomats course for French-speaking diplomats from Africa. We bid all of you a heartfelt welcome!/////It is up to your generation to create the new image of Africa and to shape future ties between Germany and Africa. Work with us for peace and development, live out our shared values. We can make freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights into a reality-in Africa, in Europe, and around the world./////Protecting human rights is an inextricable part of the connection between Europe and Africa. Human rights are the indispensable basis on which Europe and Africa can jointly help shape globalization./////Political rights are equal in importance to social and economic rights. For many years Germany has been calling for the United Nations to recognize the right to water as a human right. It is a great success that the General Assembly joined us in this position in July, and the Human Rights Council last week./////Germany has constantly worked to gain a greater say at the United Nations for the countries of the southern hemisphere./////The world is changing-the geopolitical balance is shifting eastward and southward. Africa is a part of these changes./////This holds especially true of peace and security. A Security Council without a strong African presence no longer reflects the current political reality./////We want to reform the Security Council to ensure that Africa is represented among the permanent members./////Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany. There can be no development without peace and security, as evidenced by the conflicts in Côte d'Ivoire, in the Sudan, in Somalia, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo./////That's why Germany promotes the multilateral approaches of the United Nations, the European Union and the G8, which aim for a viable African security architecture./////African security structures must grow stronger so that African solutions to African problems can be found. This is what the African Union expects of itself, an expectation which we strongly support./////The Economic Community of West African States has likewise raised its political profile beyond its original economic orientation. Progress in peace and security is all the more precious at a time when resources are scarce in the countries of West Africa. The trend in the region in recent years has been positive. The tireless work of ECOWAS has borne fruit./////I am extraordinarily pleased that Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas has received this year's German Africa Award./////Dr Chambas, your farsightedness, your courage, your political instincts and your tireless work on behalf of peace and freedom, development and reconciliation have achieved great things in West Africa./////Long before you joined ECOWAS, your reputation as a prudent mediator and conciliator preceded you./////Peaceful settlements in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in Côte d'Ivoire, in Guinea-Bissau and in Togo all bear your mark./////Under your leadership ECOWAS has also worked on solutions to the recent conflicts in Guinea and Niger. We shall miss you very much after your departure from ECOWAS. But I am confident that in other areas you will continue to act with every bit as much determination for the realization of your vision of democracy and the rule of law in West Africa./////It is above all thanks to you that democracy and the rule of law, good governance and human rights are now shared values of all ECOWAS member states./////Security and economic development can succeed only through regional cooperation. This principle has proved its worth in Europe and it is proving its worth in Africa too./////I thank you for your tireless work and unwavering commitment.//////////",0.2
Africa development,    07.06.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the occasion of Africa Day - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Fifty years ago, the world watched Africa with fascination as seventeen countries declared their independence in 1960. It was the beginning of the end of European colonization. It was the beginning of the self-determination and awakening of an entire continent./////For these reasons, the year 1960 is referred to as the ""Year of Africa"". 2010 has the potential to become a new ""Year of Africa"". The FIFA World Cup will kick off in Johannesburg just three days from now. This will be the first time this global event has ever been hosted on the African continent. It is sure to shape the world's view of Africa as a whole for years to come. We know this from experience. For us, the summer of 2006 was extremely beneficial for Ger­many's image abroad. Four years ago in Germany we celebrated our ""summer fairy tale"". As winter is just beginning in the southern hemisphere, I hope South Africa will have ""winter fairy tale""./////After the World Cup, the world will view Africa differently than it ever has before./////Four years ago the whole world was surprised by Germany. The Germans could actually be really friendly! We were able to prove many of the cliches false. Even before the World Cup the Germans were more relaxed, funny, tolerant, peaceful and hospitable than many people wanted to believe. But it was the World Cup that helped people who had never been to Ger­many understand this./////For South Africa and for the entire continent the World Cup is a huge opportunity. It is a chance to dispel an image of Africa that is burdened with prejudices. This image of Africa is, at best, a distorted picture. Africa is much more than poverty, crises and disasters. Many Afri­can economies are growing nearly as quickly as their Asian counterparts. Africa is on the rise, politically and economically, as I was able to see for myself during my trip to Tanzania, South Africa and Djibouti at the beginning of April./////I don't want to play down Africa's problems-there is certainly a lot of catching up to do. There are still many conflicts and problems to be resolved. But when I look at Africa, I see above all major opportunities and incredible potential./////We need a fresh perspective on Africa. We need a perspective that acknowledges the efforts and successes of individual countries. A perspective that looks closely at which states violate human rights and which states protect them. A modern view of Africa sees countries that are addressing the challenges their continent is facing. Increasingly, African solutions are being found for African problems./////The foundation for this was laid on Africa Day, which we are commemorating today, a bit belatedly. On 25 May 1963, 32 independent African states signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)./////This was a huge step for the young nations of Africa. Today the organization that succeeded the OAU, the African Union (AU), is a key partner for the European Union in Africa./////For instance, Germany is assisting the African Union in building an operations centre in Addis Ababa and in training Somali police officers in Ethiopia. We also support the African Union's Border Programme. The goal is to mediate border disputes before they escalate into conflicts. Along with the United Nations, we support the efforts to resolve the conflicts in Sudan. Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany./////In business, too, we would like to have more interaction. Economic exchange is indispensable for the peaceful coexistence of peoples and nations. As a member of the Free Democratic Party, I believe that close economic ties, investment, trade and entrepreneurship are key. They create jobs, growth and prosperity here in Germany as well as in Africa. The growth in many African countries is impressive. A new middle class is gradually emerging and its growing purchasing power bolsters domestic demand. An increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location. We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper. Peace and stability, economic development and cultural understanding for Africa are goals of our foreign policy./////",0.2
Africa development,    24.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Westerwelle to the German Bundestag on the continuation of German participation in the ATALANTA mission in the Horn of Africa - Federal Foreign Office ,humanitarian aid,"Ladies and gentlemen,/////Since Monday of this week, ten Somali nationals have been on trial in Hamburg accused of having hijacked a German ship off the coast of Somalia. This demonstrates very clearly how directly the problems in Somalia affect us in Germany./////To many of us, the Horn of Africa might seem to be a long way off in geographical terms, but the regular news reports are an indication that what's going on there actually affects us as well. With the EU-led ATALANTA mission we are securing the supply of humanitarian aid to the suffering people of Somalia and protecting civilian shipping./////So let me emphasize once again, to make clear what interests we are pursuing, that the whole thing was started in order to enable humanitarian aid supplies to reach the ports of Africa./////The fact that it has been possible to prevent a new humanitarian disaster in Somalia in recent years testifies to the mission's success./////ATALANTA benefits millions of people who desperately need this aid. Over 3.5 million Somalis are still dependent on humanitarian aid. This year alone ATALANTA has escorted over 30 World Food Programme ships safely into Somali ports. So anyone who wants to withdraw from this mission has to explain just exactly how he intends to ensure that this aid actually reaches the starving population. As there is no way you can do this, all of you in this House will, I believe, live up to your responsibility./////Over 90,000 tonnes of foodstuffs reached 1.8 million people./////That's why this mission is so crucial./////We can be proud of these humanitarian achievements by the European Union, to which the German Navy has made a substantial contribution. I would like to thank all the parliamentary groups who support the Bundeswehr's engagement. But my particular thanks go to the soldiers of the Bundeswehr for their commitment. It is a difficult mission, one which causes great hardship. May I ask you, Mr Parliamentary State Secretary, to convey our gratitude to our troops once again. I am certain that all of us here in the Bundestag know what an important job the men and women of the Bundeswehr are doing out there./////The mission's second aim is to protect international shipping. A foreign policy which is committed to humanitarian values can and may, indeed must, keep its own interests in view as well./////Freedom of movement on the open seas is a shared interest of the international community. In this context we are acting under the mandate of the United Nations Security Council. That too is very important to remember: this is a mandate from the United Nations Security Council./////(...)/////Ladies and gentlemen, the shipping companies can help to improve the security of the ships and especially of their crews. I am confident that the ship owners take their responsibilities seriously and that they are taking the necessary precautions. Thanks to the cooperation between the shipping companies and the security forces, the number of attacks and hijack attempts in the Gulf of Aden has fallen. But we have to remember that there are still hundreds of people in the hands of the pirates./////Moreover, the threat has taken on a new quality, because the pirates have now extended their range even as far as the Indian coast and the coast of Mozambique. In other words, the reach of the original operations area is no longer sufficient. It has therefore been extended, involving some remarkable logistics. The European Union has responded to the new situation and extended the ATALANTA operations area. That is why the Bundeswehr mandate too needs to be adapted to the new realities. The Federal Government asks this House to act accordingly./////International missions cannot sort out the repercussions of state failure by themselves. We need to seek the solution right where the problem has its roots-in Somalia itself. The fight against piracy will be won not on the high seas, but on land. And so it is right that we supplement our humanitarian aid for Somalia with support for political reconstruction. It is, quite simply, wrong to claim that we are only demonstrating military commitment and that we don't realize we have to work actively on land too to tackle the causes of the problem. That's exactly what we're doing./////At the Africa-EU Summit in Tripoli next Tuesday, we will continue to work towards a common order, a common perspective. But of course that's not enough on its own. It is a question of continuing the EU missions to train Somali security forces. We're doing that too. It is a question of implementing international projects to support the development of the judicial systems. That's another of our priorities. But it is also a question of our recognizing this: lawless areas breed instability and violence. That's why we must continue to take this networked approach. We ask for support for this important mandate./////Thank you for your attention.//////////",0.4
Africa development,    09.04.2010 - Speech,Speech by Guido Westerwelle at a dinner hosted by the Southern African German Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text__/////Mr Boddenberg,/////Mr Moller,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Thank you very much for welcoming me here today and for your kind introductory words./////On behalf of the entire delegation, I thank you most warmly for inviting us to this beautiful Club. Please also accept belated Easter greetings from Berlin./////This year is arguably the most important year for South Africa since apartheid was finally vanquished in 1994. President Jacob Zuma himself said as much only a few weeks ago./////I believe that 2010 is a crucial year not only for South Africa, but for us all-a year in which we set the course for the future./////We have just had to face the toughest economic and financial crisis-the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression of 1929./////We are still left struggling with the consequences-in Africa, Europe, all over the world./////The public finances of nearly all OECD countries have found themselves in troubled waters, and here in Africa the crisis has made a deep dent in the most consistent economic upturn in the continent's history./////I can well imagine that you of all people, as representatives of private business, must be feeling the pinch and would have your own stories to tell./////However, I can also say that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We can feel it in Germany, in the EU, but here in Africa too./////A few days ago at an economic forum in Nairobi, the IMF Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stressed that the year 2010 would see a return to growth in Africa too. ""Africa is back"" is how he put it./////""Africa is back""-at first this may seem a rather strange notion to many observers in Germany and Europe. We perceive the African continent all too often as a continent of conflicts, crises and catastrophes./////However, I know not only from my discussions in the United Republic of Tanzania and today in Pretoria, but also from early trips, that nothing could be more false than this negative image of Africa. Sometimes, I admit, one has to dig a little deeper to see the potential and unearth new opportunities./////However, if we take the trouble, there is no limit to what we can discover and achieve. Germany and South Africa-Europe and its neighbouring continent-have a wealth of values, interests and goals in common./////Let me give you a brief outline of three areas of cooperation that I consider to be of crucial importance for this year, but also well beyond 2010./////First, we need to come together both to address the most pressing challenges in security policy and draw attention to global issues./////South Africa is our strategic partner in Africa, which is especially true with regard to our efforts to build peace and security on the continent./////We are together promoting the development of rule-of-law structures in southern Sudan by means of a trilateral training programme for Sudanese judges and public prosecutors. Particularly in this critical phase for the Sudan, in which landmark decisions are to be made regarding the country's future, we must not slacken our efforts to establish a minimum rule-of-law standard. Without peace and stability in the Sudan the development of the entire region is threatened./////Particularly when it comes to solving the crisis in Zimbabwe, South Africa is the key player and President Zuma is continually engaged personally in this process. Together we must play our part in ensuring that the intended power-sharing between the various political groups succeeds. We want a government in Zimbabwe that includes all political forces-a government that is not based on fear, intimidation and persecution but that respects human rights and the principles of the rule of law./////Germany and South Africa are also working closely together on developing a pan-African security architecture. South Africa is the driving force behind both the regional association SADC and the African Union./////Here Germany stands firmly by South Africa's side-supporting, for instance, the African Union in developing a Peace Support Operations Centre in Addis Ababa and training Somali police officers in Ethiopia./////South Africa is also our strategic partner on the continent when it comes to major global issues. South Africa is a partner in the G20, where we consult closely on the most important issues relating to the international financial and economic system. We are also working together within the framework of international climate negotiations for an ambitious follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol./////I am especially delighted that, in nominating Minister of Tourism-formerly Minister for Environmental Affairs and Tourism-Marthinus van Schalkwyk, South Africa has proposed an outstanding candidate to lead the UN Climate Change Secretariat in my home town Bonn./////Let me turn now to another area of cooperation that is crucial for Germany and South Africa: economic development and economic cooperation./////South Africa is by far Germany's most important economic partner in Africa: worldwide South Africa ranks seventh place among Germany's non-European trading partners. At the same time Germany is South Africa's second most important trading partner worldwide./////There are currently around 600 German companies in South Africa and together they have created a total of 90,000 jobs. The main focuses of German enterprise are car manufacture, chemicals, and mechanical and electrical engineering./////Why do I make a point of stating this? I do this because, particularly as a politician and Foreign Minister of liberal persuasion, I am firmly convinced that economic links, investment, trade and entrepreneurship are crucial for jobs, growth and prosperity./////However, economic exchange is also indeed crucial to the peaceful coexistence of peoples and nations-and thus in our best national and European interests./////This applies even more in the age of globalization, where we can use our economic links to bring about a globalization of values as well. In this way globalization becomes a win-win situation for both sides, and not just economically./////As I see it, external economic promotion is therefore a key element in any foreign policy with an eye to the future. This applies even more to a country like Germany, where so much importance is attached to exports and to economic links as a whole./////Here I would like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution. I cannot praise highly enough the work of the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad: a total of 120 spread across 80 different countries. Not only do they open doors: they also build bridges./////They are ambassadors for our country and our economy. I especially welcome your commit­ment with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility. Social responsibility is not an alien concept to German businesses, at home or abroad; rather, it is part and parcel of a modern business philosophy that is in keeping with the times. This is the globalization of values in action./////I strongly encourage you to continue along this path. I'm sure your efforts will shine through, both in the quality of your products and, ultimately, in your balance sheets./////I also speak for my colleague Dirk Niebel, who is accompanying me on this Africa tour, when I say this. By the way, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first major trip to Africa in almost twenty years by a Federal Foreign Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development./////There is no place for institutional rivalry in the tasks that lie ahead. On the contrary, what we require is a seamless policy on Africa. This will also find its expression in the Federal Government's strategy for Africa, which we are working on together./////This is especially true in the case of a partner country like South Africa, which has long since outgrown the classic label of developing country and is itself now a development aid provider./////This makes it all the more important that we reach agreement on specific areas where we share a common interest, for instance on energy and climate policy, climate technology, or vocational training. The intergovernmental negotiations which ended today, that focused on defining the priorities for our future work, set a most encouraging tone for our continuing cooperation in areas of relevance to the years to come./////Finally, I would like to address a third area of cooperation that is especially close to my heart and relevant here to our policy on Africa: cultural relations and education policy./////We live in the age of globalization. This is not an aspect we can choose to switch on or off at our convenience, but a fact of life that we have to come to terms with, for better or worse./////I believe globalization brings with it immense opportunities. Politically and economically, but also culturally. Where distances shrivel to nothing and communication knows no limits, there the principles of cultural understanding can flourish-the principles by which we learn not only from one another but in each other's best interests./////This is precisely the approach we need: active promotion of the German language, particu­larly in Africa; strengthening the Goethe-Institut; cooperating in education, science and sport. Having just visited the science park and innovation centre, I have been deeply impressed by how much South Africa in particular is investing in research and innovation, in the develop­ment of high-tech solutions./////Knowledge is the key resource of the 21st century. Education is the social issue of the age of globalization./////This is as true for Europe as it is for Africa. Enhanced cooperation in the fields of education, research and innovation is therefore exactly the right way to capitalize together on the oppor­tunities that globalization affords-and this applies to South Africa just as much as it does to Germany./////Africa is on the ascent. The continent's population is young, motivated and hungry for education./////A few weeks ago, the American publication Newsweek was talking about the possibility of Africa becoming the new Asia./////With its increasing buying power, a new middle class is emerging that is bolstering domestic demand. A middle class whose motivation and zeal ensure that more and more international companies are discovering Africa as a location for investment. And finally, a middle class that wants political participation and upholds the values of democracy and the rule of law./////We want to strengthen these positive forces on the African continent: we want to support Africa in its ascent-with policies that favour partnership in the pursuit of peace and stability, in the pursuit of economic development and cultural understanding./////It is 62 days to kick-off. South Africa is to host this year's FIFA World Cup. The enthusiasm is already palpable. I am certain that this first FIFA World Cup on African soil will be a mega event-a unique opportunity for the country, indeed for the whole continent./////Let us use this mood of optimism to promote a new image of the African continent-one that moves far beyond the old doom and gloom or an all too naive African romanticism./////We need a realistic image of Africa, one that recognizes the opportunities as well as the challenges that lie ahead. If we can succeed in this, then together we can reach the right decisions, so that 2010 becomes not just the ""first post-crisis year"", but a year when we all make the ascent together./////Thank you very much./////",0.2
Africa development,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
Africa development,    15.03.2010 - Speech,Address by Guido Westerwelle at the German-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __///////////////Mr Governor,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Let me first of all thank you most sincerely for this invitation./////In the coming years, the world will look to Brazil to a greater extent than perhaps ever before./////Just a few years ago, we in Germany experienced to what degree global sporting events shape a country's image. The motto of summer 2006 was ""A time to make friends"". That wasn't an advertising slogan, it was reality. Even those who would never dream of going to a stadium on a Saturday to watch a league game couldn't escape the enthusiasm which gripped the entire country./////No-one who was there has forgotten how people sat or stood in the streets or in cafes and celebrated together./////No-one will forget the friendly atmosphere which was palpable at every street corner./////People all around the world recall the images of laughter and cheers, and of tears, too, which flowed when a team was eliminated from the tournament./////That's what sport is all about: it's about the competition, about the best performance, about fair play, about skill and talent, as well as about emotions which touch everyone./////What we're talking about today attracts less attention. The images I've just described can only materialize if planning and organization are coordinated to perfection. The preparation is successful if it is no longer consciously perceived once the first game kicks off./////The questions which you in Rio de Janeiro must answer are the same as the ones we in Germany had to answer prior to the 2006 World Cup./////I'd like to mention just a few./////How can stadia be used meaningfully once the final is over and the Cup has been presented? How can transport links be planned so that new bus and train routes serve the local population in the long term? How can investments help to make cities safer, cleaner and more attractive to live in?/////And how can the population be involved in the planning so that people accept and take advantage of the changes these developments entail?/////Sport will change Rio de Janeiro. You're therefore right to look now at what happens after the World Cup./////I'm delighted that you are doing so in collaboration with German business./////For German business gained valuable experience in how to make global sporting events a success when it helped to prepare the World Cup in Germany./////We should see the World Cup and the Olympic Games as shared opportunities to set the course for the future in Rio./////Cooperation has already begun. Architects and construction companies from Germany were sought-after partners for the World Cup in South Africa and the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. And German architects are currently planning four World Cup stadia in Brazil./////Following reunification, Germany renewed-and in some cases built from scratch-large parts of the transport and communications infrastructure in eastern Germany./////We can put this experience to use in the coming years. For transport-especially on medium-range routes, Germany developed state-of-the-art trains which combine eco-friendliness and speed. Just take the high-speed ICE train, which only takes 90 minutes to travel between Germanys largest two cities, Berlin and Hamburg. That's a distance of just under 300 kilometres. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are only about 50 kilometres further apart./////Alongside transport, energy supply also offers opportunities for close cooperation. Regenerative energies are being used more both inside and outside the stadia./////Germany leads the world when it comes to solar energy-and to wind energy, too, for that matter. If we join forces, we will send key messages about Brazil's long-term energy supply strategy./////German business has launched the Initiative WinWin 2014/16 for the sporting events of the coming decade./////Within this framework, German companies are positioning themselves to prepare for potential projects in connection with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Games./////I'm delighted that the Chairman of this initiative, Dr Zoller, is accompanying me on this tour. I'm confident that the Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro will do everything it can to support these projects./////The Initiative demonstrates how important German-Brazilian economic relations are. Our economies are closely linked to one another. I believe I speak for everyone present when I say that I hope our relations will be even more intensive in future./////My trip has taken me to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil because I wanted to gain a first-hand impression of your continent's dynamism./////The impressions I take home with me will go into the strategy on Latin America on which the German Government is currently working./////I have emphasized time and again during my trip that we have to shape globalization positively. The fact that as Foreign Minister I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal is an important part of that.//////////",0.1
Africa development,    10.06.2010 - Speech,Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle addresses the German Bundestag regarding the UNMIS and UNAMID missions in Sudan/Darfur - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Madam President,ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, /////2010 and 2011 will certainly be defining years for the Sudan. Just a few weeks ago, on 11 April, elections were held in the Sudan for the first time in over 24 years. The people exercised their fundamental democratic right to vote in substantial numbers and civil society displayed courageous engagement./////However, we also know that the election definitely did not meet international standards. The international community rightly criticized the numerous manipulations as being unacceptable. Along with the international community, we call for the Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court. Very serious crimes, such as those committed in Darfur, must be punished; I would like to clearly reiterate that here./////The situation in Darfur continues to be characterized by violence. Time and again, the Doha ceasefire between the government and the rebel groups is broken. The people of Darfur fall victim to the civil war and to criminals who take advantage of the strained security situation./////In Southern Sudan as well, there continue to be bouts of violence between the different ethnic groups. There are countless extralegal militias. There is a threat that these conflicts could be further escalated by extremist forces from northern Sudan. Observers and experts do not exclude the possibility of a renewed outbreak of civil war between north and south./////Given the situation, the Sudan needs greater commitment from the international community-not less. This is also what the interparty proposal on this issue before the German Bundestag rightly calls for. The Federal Government will make this proposal and its constructive recommendations the foundation of its policy. On this basis, we will advocate in international forums and bodies the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as well as a peace treaty for Darfur. In this respect there are five points that are especially important for our engagement that I would like to mention here./////First, the referendum on Southern Sudan's independence must be transparent and peaceful. It is decisive for the future of the Sudan that the outcome be accepted by all parties. The conditions for this must be created now. According to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the referendum must be held by 2011. Providing security for the referendum is one of the key tasks UNMIS has to perform. To ensure that election standards are met, in the European Union we are pushing for a large and comprehensive election observation mission./////Second, Southern Sudan needs stronger state structures. This is essential for the stability of the entire region. During my trip to Africa, my interlocutors in Djibouti and Tanzania stressed the risks an unstable Southern Sudan would present to the entire region. Alongside preparations for the referendum, training security forces in Southern Sudan and disarming extralegal militias is UNMIS's primary task. The southern part of the Sudan will only have a peaceful future if national authorities can guarantee the protection of the civilian population. The German Government can continue to make important contributions to strengthening state structures. There will also be a huge need for advice in the event that the majority of voters vote for Southern Sudan's independence in the referendum. It is necessary to prepare for this possibility even before the referendum because an overwhelming majority of observers believe this is the probable outcome of the vote. We certainly do not want to anticipate the outcome of the vote, but we must be prepared./////Third, we need a successful outcome in the peace talks on Darfur. In the long run, only an agreement among all the conflicting parties will restore calm to the situation. In Berlin this May I assured the United Nations and African Union Chief Mediator Bassole that he had the full support of the German Government. Despite all the setbacks, he is confident that the negotiations will make progress by the end of this year. Of course we hope he is right and that his efforts are successful. Until there is a negotiated solution, and probably even after that, UNAMID in Darfur faces a very difficult task. That is why we will continue to do all we can to support the mission./////Fourth, we cannot reduce our humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts. The people in Darfur depend on the support of the international community. Even if it is not possible to prevent violence everywhere, at least it is possible to alleviate the consequences./////Fifth, and finally, there has to be long-term improvement in the human rights situation across all of the Sudan. We will only see progress here if the security forces in both the north and the south are guided by rule of law criteria. Therefore I repeat that extralegal militias must be disarmed and reintegrated into civilian life. Better education and support within the framework of a demobilization programme is indispensable./////Through the peacekeeping missions, the United Nations is assisting the Sudan in conflict resolution. Germany wants to and will continue to contribute in this regard. The Bundestag mandate for UNMIS is to be extended without any changes to its content. For UNAMID the Federal Government is requesting that the personnel ceiling be adjusted from its current 250 soldiers to 50 soldiers. Within the framework of the mandate, it is no longer necessary for us to arrange flights for the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces) because UNAMID has found reliable solutions for air transport. These are the facts behind the reduction. This adjustment does not mean Germany is reducing its commitment to UNAMID. The mandate is simply being adjusted to future requirements. This serves to maintain the true purpose of the mandate and its clarity, which the German Bundestag rightly values./////Finally, I would like to expressly thank our soldiers, police officers, humanitarian aid and development cooperation workers, as well as our diplomats for all of their hard work. They are making a very important contribution, as I believe we can all imagine, under extremely difficult living and working conditions./////I ask you to support this mandate./////",0.2
Africa development,    02.05.2010 - Speech,Dinner Speech by Guido Westerwelle on the occasion of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue - Federal Foreign Office ,International Conference,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Excellencies,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to my home town. Bonn is where I grew up, I went to university here, and the Rhineland is also my political home./////The Federal Government Guest House here on the Petersberg has a long history. In the past major international conferences have been successfully held in this venue. The name Peters­berg stands for peace and security through international cooperation. With this in mind, I would like to wish us all a successful conference./////The fight against climate change is one of the central issues of the 21st century. This theme is closely related to the city of Bonn. As Germany's main United Nations site, Bonn hosts, for example, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change./////The Federal Government wants to promote and further develop Bonn as a UN location. This is also an expression of our commitment to the UN itself./////The global economic and financial crisis has not slowed down or halted the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of an advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely to arise owing to a scarcity of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must stop global problems turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops according to a set of rules and values in order to preserve peace and security in the long term./////Climate change is one of the key challenges facing humanity. The consequences of our actions won't be clear to all until the distant future. But we need a global consensus now. In this age of globalization, climate protection is a cross-cutting task for politics, business, science and society as a whole./////Climate change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and social development of whole continents and indeed of the entire international community. Climate policy issues therefore form a major part of our foreign policy which is aimed at achieving and maintaining peace and security./////With each year that passes it will become more difficult and expensive to resolve the climate issue, and its impact will be more dramatic. We still have time to limit global warming to 2°C./////We must reverse the global trend of constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions by 2020./////Time is short. The window of opportunity for joint global solutions is closing. But this must not be an excuse for us to give up our ambitious goals, which remain necessary and achiev­able./////Unchecked climate change jeopardizes respect for fundamental human rights. It particularly threatens one of the most basic human rights, that to life in a healthy environment./////Especially in those countries that have done the least to cause global warming, the very exist­ence of millions is in danger./////The fight against climate change is also an opportunity, however. We have the chance to create the framework for sustainable, qualitative growth at global level./////It is not about giving up the idea of growth. Those who do not aim for growth will not become prosperous. It's a question of qualitative growth which is sustainable, resource-friendly and which contributes to climate protection./////That is a huge challenge, but above all it is a great opportunity. At global level a modern industry can be established which produces in an environment-friendly way, enables growth and innovation, and creates jobs. Education and innovation are the primary factors here./////For that reason, too, the Federal Government, soon after taking office, decided to invest an additional 12 billion euro in education and research./////I personally see a broad area for cooperation to our mutual benefit in the field of environment and climate protection, energy and infrastructure. This especially applies to the promotion of new technologies. Germany will be happy to make a contribution with its expertise in the renewable energies and energy efficiency sector./////As foreign minister the theme of climate and security is of special concern to me, as climate change can lead to internal instability in countries and regions and have a dramatic impact on relations between peoples./////We are already seeing changes in the way people live in many parts of the world due to global warming. We must assume that climate change will bring rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions and droughts. The consequences are clear-food and water shortages, disease, rural depopulation and migration./////For some countries this threat is directly tangible./////My recent talks with the President of Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, greatly moved me. He vividly drove home the danger facing the small island states due to global warming-today their very existence is threatened./////To simply accept or ignore this is not an option for us!/////We will use all the foreign-policy tools at our disposal with regard to climate change: clas­sical diplomacy, development policy, international education policy and the promotion of innovation and high tech./////Climate protection has become one of the major policy issues worldwide, also in the foreign-policy field. Climate protection and the promotion of new technologies feature in almost all my visits abroad. Whether in China, Japan, Brazil, South Africa or Tanzania, all are aware how urgent the problem is./////But we must still agree on how to jointly achieve our objective. It will not be easy, but there is no alternative. We can bring our experiences from classical foreign policy into that process./////Hans-Dietrich Genscher once put forward three options for the multipolar world he saw on the horizon://///The first is a world without rules, sanctions or responsibility. This he called the chaos option./////The second is a world in which individual states can set the global rules due to their economic or military strength. This is a dangerous option./////The third option is global cooperation based on equal rights and status for all nations, states and regions. That is the cooperation option./////Chaos is not an option, nor is rule by individual states or regions, if a global consensus has to be brought about. The name Petersberg stands for the third, the cooperation option, cooper­ation based on equal rights and status for all nations./////The cooperation option requires far sighted and responsible action, also at regional level. Only this option offers the prospect of sustainable, long-term success./////The cooperation option means more than just mutual consideration and an appeal to shared responsibility. It means harmonizing our values and interests. This is our common task./////Since the Second World War Europe has gathered experience of how to build mutual confi­dence in spite of fundamental differences./////Take the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe (CSCE), which played a major role in ending the Cold War. Through the CSCE and its successor, the OSCE, we have built up a great deal of mutual trust in Europe. In this way German reunification became possible and the division of our continent was overcome./////Today's world is facing a similar challenge. Europe wants to set the pace in achieving a global consensus on how to combat climate change./////",0.3
Africa development,    06.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle at the opening of the Ambassadors Conference at the Federal Foreign Office - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advence text __/////Esteemed Colleague,/////Excellencies,/////Members of the German Bundestag,/////Guests and friends of the Federal Foreign Office,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I bid you a warm welcome to this year's conference of heads of German missions abroad./////It's a special pleasure for me to welcome my Mexican colleague Patricia Espinosa Cantellano as today's guest of honour. Many of you know her as a former ambassador to our country, as a friend of Germany and of the German language. We're very pleased to have you here!/////Ladies and gentlemen, during the past few months I've visited many of you in your missions. Some of you are here for the first time. I'm looking forward to discussing the direction and focuses of German foreign policy with you over the next few days./////Our work is often determined by our unsettled world's current crises and conflicts. It's therefore all the more important to have a clear view of the long-term challenges. For that reason I want to concentrate today on the three major priorities I see for German foreign policy and which we've already made serious efforts to tackle in past months://///First, shaping globalization through values-based and interest-oriented policies./////Second, a German peace and security policy built around disarmament and non-proliferation, in close cooperation with our allies and partners./////Third, strengthening and advancing European integration as the foundation of German foreign policy./////I./////If we want to shape globalization we need like-minded partners. Four weeks ago the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America concept. Latin America is the focus of this first Ambassadors Conference to be held during my term in office. I'm well aware that some people derided this choice at the beginning, but those who, like me, have experienced this continent's spirit of renewal and fantastic dynamism, as well as its affinity to Europe, will know what opportunities and potential this region possesses./////A German foreign policy that sees itself as both values-based and interest-oriented has always set its sights on both aspects. As a major trading nation we must have the big picture of global dynamism. This is why, during my first months in office, I travelled to China, Russia and Africa. In a few weeks' time we will on behalf of the Federal Government present a new Africa concept designed to revamp our policy towards this continent, too./////This October I will visit India./////However, I also visited Latin America because I see these countries as our natural partners in shaping globalization. Latin America is characterized to a greater extent than other regions outside the ""West"" by the values of the European Enlightenment. We share the values of individual liberty and the rule of law with most countries in this region./////Over the coming months and years Latin America will increasingly become the focus of attention. This November, in Cancun in Mexico, we will renew our efforts towards international climate protection. Mexico will take over the chair of the G20 from our French neighbours. In 2014 during the FIFA World Cup, and during the 2016 Olympic Games, the eyes of the world will be on Brazil. Latin America is a multi-faceted continent, and we want to help it find solutions to its most pressing issues, such as internal security. But above all I want to focus attention on the huge opportunities and the political and social potential which lie in closer relations with Latin America./////We need strong partners like Latin America so that we can back up the globalization of markets with the globalization of values./////To give globalization a human face we need a strong United Nations in line with 21st century reality. The greater significance of the Southern countries must be reflected in the Security Council. We're working for a reform of the Security Council to ensure that Africa and Latin America are also permanently represented./////Germany is facing up to its responsibility in the UN. While a permanent seat on the Security Council is our long-term policy aim, Germany is currently standing for non-permanent membership of the Council for 2011 and 2012./////Our election campaign is making good progress. With your daily work you are creating the trust your host countries' governments place in Germany, and for this I thank you. Keep up this good work so that we will have the majority we need during the elections in the General Assembly in mid October!/////Global trade isn't what's new about globalization-we've had that for centuries. The new factor is time, the incredible speed with which it takes place. As late as the 19th century major economic and social changes often took 50 years to happen. Today maybe 15 or 20 years can decide whether nations rise or fall./////A nation's wealth is no longer mainly its raw materials. Education is becoming more and more important. Knowledge arises from hard work, not from geological coincidence. We need more education out of respect for the generations to come. Children don't need good schools so that they do well in the PISA test, they need schools so that they can make the best use of their talents and live life to the fullest./////It's also a question of our society's competitiveness. We need good schools and universities to hold our own in the global competition for the brightest students. Only if our universities remain attractive can we keep our high flyers in Germany, only then will we encourage gifted young people from other countries to study here./////In this case, too, interests and values interact. Those who return home after studying here maintain links with Germany and disseminate our values in their own countries. Our cultural relations and education policy makes Germany more competitive, while at the same time helping to globalize our values./////An active cultural relations and education policy isn't a luxury but wise and far-sighted. Partner schools and Goethe-Institute, university partnerships and the promotion of talented young people are elements of a foreign and globalization policy which is in Germany's vested interests./////Latin America gives us many examples of such cooperation. Together with Chile and Colombia we have set up Centres of Excellence. In São Paulo, the largest German business community abroad, a German Science and Innovation Forum is being created. In Buenos Aires we will open a German-Argentinian University Centre and a Max Planck Partner Institute. In Mexico there are German professorships./////Dear colleague, you are living proof of Germany's cultural relations and education policy. I first met Patricia Espinosa Cantellano this April. She went to the German School in Mexico, speaks excellent German, and was her country's ambassador in Berlin and Vienna. Our shared language and access to culture links us and enables us to cooperate to the benefit of both our countries./////Mexico and Germany are ideal partners in the quest for values-based globalization. During the next few months, dear colleague, you can count on our support in making the Cancun climate summit a success under your chairmanship./////Education policy is just one example of the extent to which our country's influence abroad depends on our performance at home. Domestic and foreign policy are becoming increasingly interlinked. Only an economically strong country can have sufficient foreign-policy clout./////It's therefore important not only from a domestic-policy but also from a foreign-policy standpoint that we take the right road in the financial and economic crisis. The Federal Government's budget cuts are painful, also for the Federal Foreign Office, but if we use our budget wisely Germany will in the medium term have more, rather than less, of a role to play on the foreign policy stage./////II./////The second key priority is a German security and peace policy that is in keeping with the times./////On a current note, let me first say that Germany will do everything in its power to help ensure success of the direct talks that have just begun between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is the two sides that have to make peace with one another. That we cannot do for them. But we will continue to do all we can to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. The first German-Palestinian Steering Committee that met this spring in Berlin has taken our cooperation with the Palestinians to a new level. This close cooperation has met with strong approval not only in the Arab world, but also in Israel. That is important to us-because the security and bright future of Israel is and will remain a fundamental pillar of German policy./////At the beginning of this government's term of office, there was a need to reshape Germany's engagement in Afghanistan. We have done a level-headed and honest stocktaking./////This included reassessing the operation and determining that, from an international humanitarian law perspective, it is an armed conflict. On this basis, we have drawn up a strategy that, first, realistically defines our objectives, second, brings deployment of our military and civilian assets in line with these objectives and, third, clearly highlights the need for a political solution./////The mission in Afghanistan is certainly not popular. But it remains necessary, and it serves our core security interests. Looking at the country today, it still presents a mixed picture with more and less encouraging developments. Yet in recent months we have achieved a great deal, and we want to continue our steady progress down this path./////At the London Conference in January, we closely coordinated our strategy both within NATO and with the international community./////We have markedly increased our presence in Afghanistan at all levels. I would like to extend to the diplomats, service members, police officers and reconstruction workers my deep respect and gratitude for the duties they are performing there for our country, in very difficult conditions./////A few weeks ago in Kabul, we set out a roadmap. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 18 September, and they are the first to be organized under sole Afghan responsibility. This November at the NATO Summit in Lisbon, we will be taking a decision on whether to hand over security responsibility in several regions of the country./////By 2014, we want to have transferred security responsibility for the entire country to the Government of Afghanistan, in line with President Karzai's objective./////By following this roadmap, we are creating the real prospect for a withdrawal of our women and men in uniform, and for an Afghanistan in which Afghan women and men once again will take charge of their own destiny. Yet our benchmark remains that a threat to international security must no longer emanate from Afghanistan./////Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan is key to stabilizing the entire region. The flooding in recent weeks has caused unthinkable destruction and human suffering./////We have provided rapid and effective assistance; beyond the humanitarian aid offered during the initial weeks, we will remain engaged in reconstruction and political reform efforts. Pakistan deserves to be a special focus of our attention, on both a humanitarian and political level./////Despite these crises that we are facing right now, we must not lose sight of the long-term security and peace policy challenges. On Sunday, we will mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the 2+4 Treaty, a masterpiece of foreign policy and a milestone on the path to German unity. This is a fitting occasion to thank our partners and allies in the transatlantic community for helping bring about a Germany that is united and free./////The Alliance remains the foundation of our security. But the world has changed in fundamental ways. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a significant increase in the nuclear threat due to the proliferation of weapons and missile technology. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons poses one of the greatest threats to our security. Mitigating this development is a question of survival. Disarmament is therefore not a 1980s issue, and it is not a pipe dream; rather, in our globalized world, it is a necessity./////The conclusion of a new START Treaty between Russia and the United States marked the encouraging beginning to a decade that must become a decade of disarmament./////At the NPT Review Conference held in New York last May, tactical nuclear weapons were for the first time included in the disarmament effort, which was a success for the policies of this Federal Government and the German Bundestag./////It is our aim, on the one hand, to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and, on the other hand, to reduce the existing stockpiles of these weapons. These are two sides of the same coin. That is why the controversy surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme goes far beyond its regional implications; it is in fact a global issue./////We are going to great lengths to ensure that disarmament and arms control will remain a key issue, also within NATO's new Strategic Concept that is to be adopted at the Lisbon Summit in November. This will create the opportunity for us to devise a truly cooperative security architecture for all of Europe, expressly including Russia. The initiative presented by myself together with the Foreign Ministers of the Benelux countries and Norway at the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Tallinn last April regarding the reduced significance of nuclear weapons within NATO served this same purpose./////In the long term, we remain committed to President Obama's Global Zero vision, that is a world without nuclear weapons. We have quite a long way to go. But in formulating our policy, we will not lose sight of this goal./////Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction already on their own pose a great threat to us all. We must do everything within our power to prevent them from entering unholy alliances, and their becoming a curse brought about by globalization./////III./////Probably the greatest challenge, but also the most rewarding task, of German foreign policy is the construction of Europe./////A united Europe is the foundation on which German foreign policy rests. Europe is not everything, but without Europe everything is nothing./////In May, we needed to take two consecutive, very difficult decisions to shield the euro-and thus Europe-from a severe crisis. These difficult weeks made it clear to all of us that European integration must be fought for again and again. It is not a permanent condition. It is also not ""irreversible"". Eurobarometer public opinion polls point to a dramatic drop in Europe's approval rating in Germany. I am deeply worried about this, but I am also highly determined to work for, and champion the cause of, the construction of Europe. I ask you all to join me in this effort./////For us Germans, a united Europe is not some luxury that we could, if need be, do without. It guarantees our prosperity, our peace and our freedom./////To keep it this way, we Europeans must make progress on reducing deficits, and we must put in place strict rules governing new borrowing. This is the only option for restoring sound growth to Europe. It is obviously in all EU member states' own interest to keep the euro healthy. Stability of the euro is everyone's responsibility. If anyone opts out of our common responsibility for Europe, this must automatically have consequences in the form of sanctions./////Rule violators should be barred from receiving money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to everyone, no matter how large or powerful a European country it may be. We want a European Union of responsibility, and not one of transfer payments, where a country can shirk responsibility and hope for a bailout. These are our objectives in ongoing negotiations within the van Rompuy led group./////Strengthening cohesion within the European Union is dear to my heart. For a strong and united Europe, we want to reinforce ties with partners to our east as much as to our west, ties that have been nurtured over decades. My first trip abroad as Foreign Minister was to Warsaw. Germany's relations with France and with Poland are both top priority. Here, there is no ""either _ or"", it is always an ""and""./////We have successfully reactivated the Weimar Triangle. It is becoming a driving force of European policy./////During my first year in office, I visited European member states regardless of their population size-because the European project has no use for sorting countries according to their importance; rather, all member states must stand as one./////Only on the basis of this internal cohesion can we use Europe's international clout to our advantage. In the coming days, we will hold intensive discussions in Brussels about Europe's relations with strategic partners such as China and India./////During my recent travels to Turkey and the Western Balkan countries, I saw that the European project for peace and prosperity remains as attractive as ever. In these countries, the prospect of drawing closer to the EU is probably the strongest factor driving reform./////In all of this we must, however, be certain that our citizens stand behind our policies. Europe is only strong when its citizens support the construction of Europe and recognize the truly inestimable value it holds for our country./////Before I ask my Mexican colleague to take the floor, I want to address an issue that many of my co workers here at this ministry have been giving much thought to, namely the future of our foreign service./////The world is constantly changing, regardless of our need to save money. Across the globe, power is shifting. We must closely examine and adapt how we use our resources. At the same time, we are in the process of establishing a European External Action Service./////This will cause some of you to wince and say that, in your area, efficiencies have been maximized, changes and savings are simply not possible. My answer to this is, you must view this situation as an opportunity./////Continual change is one of the few constant factors of diplomatic life. Just as you have done for yourself, the Federal Foreign Office must develop an institutional culture of change. Who would know better than you which changes are required? Let me thank all Foreign Office staff, from local staff to ambassadors, who have contributed to the fruitful discussions on our intranet ""forum for the future""./////We will discuss the results during this Ambassadors Conference, for one thing. But the project ""AA 2020"" will continue, so that the Foreign Office will remain ready and able to lead German foreign policy./////In the diplomacy business, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. Crises, whether natural disasters or man made, are not predictable./////We require structures that can quickly adapt to changes. Above all, we need staff who find the right solutions in unusual situations. During the ten months that I have been in office, I have again and again been reaffirmed in my view that Foreign Office staff do great work and effectively promote our country's interests abroad. I know that their efforts are also highly respected in the German Bundestag./////Please take my thanks back to your missions, pass it on to your colleagues, and especially also to their families and partners./////For centuries, Germans have found a new home in Latin America, where they have seized opportunities and achieved success. Today we are partners in globalization. I am pleased about our long-standing, close ties with Mexico that are based on trust, and I now have the honour to hand the floor over to the Secretary of Foreign Relations of the United Mexican States./////Dear Colleague, dear Patricia, over to you./////",0.1
Africa development,    07.09.2010 - Speech,Opening speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the Business Forum at the 2010 Ambassadors Conference in Berlin on 7 September 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advance text __//////////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I am absolutely delighted to be able to welcome so many of you here to the Weltsaal at the Federal Foreign Office. I have been told that interest in the Business Forum at the Ambassadors Conference has never been as great as this year. This I find very gratifying, as it suggests you are optimistic about our country's opportunities and about its economic development./////I should like to extend a very warm welcome to the President of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services, Mr Anton Borner. Thank you very much for agreeing to address our Business Forum./////I would also like to welcome the top man at the Federal Economics Ministry, Federal Economics Minister Rainer Brderle, acting for the first time as something of a joint host at this event with us at the Federal Foreign Office. This is the first time that we, in our capacities as Economics Minister and Foreign Minister, have opened this Business Forum together. And I am delighted, Rainer, that you will be speaking to our many guests here today./////That, too, is undoubtedly an expression of cooperation. Allow me to welcome our many guests of honour, particularly of course the representatives of the parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag. A warm welcome to all the dignitaries. Protocol would require that they should all be welcomed personally, but in the interest of keeping things short, I will mention just one of their number. It is a privilege to welcome former Federal Economics Minister Professor Helmut Haussmann here today./////This Business Forum is taking place at a time when the German economy is very clearly recovering, catching up, regaining its old strength. After all, Germany's strength in the world primarily depends not on our military capability or the strength of our forces, although these are all important. No, it is Germany's economic strength which is the key to our influence and possibilities in the world. Germany's strength and international image depend not on military capacities, but first and foremost on diplomatic skill, on responsibility and humanity, and on our economic power. Together, these make up our political and moral authority in the world. And that is why I am particularly keen for foreign policy, too, to play its part in ensuring our country's economic success. When German foreign policy says it wants to promote economic opportunities for German businesses in the world, it may at first seem rather suspect to many people. In other countries, ambassadors and politicians, and even foreign ministers, would be criticized if they did not help their own economy to be successful. But in our case, sometimes, things go in precisely the opposite direction. And to my mind it is important to overcome this. Just as our close friends, our European neighbours, regard it as obvious that politics should open doors in the world for the country's own companies, the same must become obvious in Germany. And some of these debates we are having-and here I don't only mean the debates of recent weeks, but those of recent months as well-about whether politics is the business world's lackey when it tries to improve business opportunities-would be absolutely inconceivable in other countries in Europe no less sovereign or democratic than we are, no less structured and oriented to the rule of law./////Quite simply, the reality is that things in the world are shifting. We are living in a time of upheaval. A time of global upheaval. Things we are concerned with here in Germany, demographic development for instance, have to be discussed beyond the boundaries of national issues at global level: demographic development, i.e. changing age structures in society in Germany, in Europe, in comparison with other young continents. After all, this demographic development is not merely a challenge for us, for our national social security systems. It is also a challenge for foreign policy, because it is just a question of time until the young societies, those booming, dynamic societies which twenty years ago were shrugged off as developing countries, having become major emerging nations, also demand to be political, cultural and intellectual centres. These countries, these regions, won't be content just to sell us resources and have us sell them products. Rather, they will want a say in ""big politics"". That is why, although the G8 is certainly an important format, we are all aware that the G20 is becoming more and more important as a format for shaping globalization. Countries which, twenty years ago, or in my student days, really were still developing countries are now joining us as equal partners at international level at the round table or negotiating table. And not just when it comes to the area for which Rainer Brderle is responsible, namely economic policy, but also, of course, when it comes to the Middle East or crisis regions, or global issues. A country like Turkey, for example, regards its tremendous economic development as entitling it to have a say on other issues. That's what we're experiencing just now, not least in discussions on strategic orientation in Turkey. A country like Brazil, for example, with its amazing success story of recent years, not only claims the right to speak with us on economic issues, most recently at the German-Brazilian Economic Forum in Munich, but also, when President Lula or soon his successor appears on the world stage, then with the authority of his own economy, his own society. He goes to the Middle East, for instance, and tries to make his mark on the peace process./////Brazil, Argentina, China-all these upcoming countries are, of course, to a certain extent new competitors for us. But first and foremost they embody huge opportunities. They are markets for German products. And we are working hard to make these countries Germany's partners when it comes to peace, security and prosperity in the world too./////As an export nation, Germany needs to keep a very close eye on developments in the world. And I'm quite sure that Rainer Brderle, as Economics Minister and as one who has many years-actually, ungallant as it may be to say it-decades of experience in international politics, will be saying something about the markets, about the possibilities for cooperation. But what I am also concerned with is partnership that goes beyond economic considerations, partnership which emerges from positive economic development to bring stability, prosperity and peace./////With its 229 missions abroad, the Foreign Service is a true global network. And all the heads of mission you might talk to here today also have a dense network of contacts in their host country. They know who to talk to and can help open doors./////This may not be very important for a huge, globally operating company with tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of staff. Big companies like that are able to establish their own representations to conquer markets all around the world. But the many small and medium-sized enterprises are highly dependent on finding open doors at the chambers of commerce abroad, but also at our diplomatic missions, so that our diplomatic missions can in turn open other doors for them. These smaller companies are not in a position to keep up a dense network of representatives and offices around the world. That is why a sensible external economic affairs policy is predominantly in the interest of SMEs. And, incidentally, in the interest of their workers and the jobs they create./////The environmentfor exports and investments abroad certainly hasn't got any easier. In fact, in some countries it has become much more complicated./////German companies and German products are highly regarded abroad. ""Made in Germany"" was once intended as a taint on German products. But for a long time now ""Made in Germany"" has been a sign of the quality of German firms. What's behind ""Made in Germany""? What do people think of when they read that? Firstly, quality and reliability. And this reputation for reliability which German products rightly have is one which German politics needs to have abroad too, because the two go together. This is our excellent calling card./////So the economic sphere presents a great opportunity for our country, and expressly also for foreign policy. Foreign policy is globalization policy. I don't simply mean globalization of markets; I am calling for a comprehensive interpretation of globalization. It is also a matter of the globalization of values./////When we talk about globalization in Germany, we occasionally let fall the disparaging word ""globalism"". A real process is turned into an ""ism"", an ideology. As if we could just close our eyes and the rest of the world would immediately show consideration to Germany and Central Europe. You all know that this is not the case. Indeed, everyone in this country feels that this is not the case. But somehow we haven't yet really taken it on board. Globalization isn't just about trade, the exchange of goods, economic relations; no, globalization is also about the spread of values, of the rule of law. And the businesspeople gathered here today know full well that the rule of law is not just a human rights or civil rights goal which stirs our hearts; rather, it is of course also a question of reliability. Countries which cannot give their own citizens rule of law structures will not be regarded as reliable sites for investment. There is a connection here too. This is not the primacy of economics in human and civil rights, but rather it is the idea that countries with a rule of law deficit have to have it made clear to them: it is right for you, for your development, to embrace the rule of law and to completely accept and practise human rights./////Of course it is also a matter of modern infrastructure in developing and emerging economies, or of easier access to water and electricity. But this is not merely an act of humanity. Nor is it merely altruism, solidarity between individuals, solidarity between nations and countries; rather it is also a chance to get orders for German companies in the energy or infrastructure sector. Having visited many countries in my first few months in office, I can tell you that Germany has an extremely good reputation./////Development and prosperity in turn lead to stability, security and peace in the world. Economic development stabilizes societies. Increasing prosperity, particularly in poorer countries, stabilizes societies and inclines them more to peace. Wherever people have no chance to make anything of their lives, wherever people are in despair, they are naturally vulnerable to extremism and then also fundamentalism and terrorism. This is one of the reasons why we at the Federal Foreign Office put so much effort into handling crisis regions. It is not just because it is, in a way, a debt to humanity, but also because it is in our own interest to bear in mind the link between stabilization and economic and social opportunities in these countries, and thus also a peaceful world./////Latin America is one of Germany's partner regions. Four weeks ago, the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America Strategy. We want to raise our relations with the continent to a new qualitative level. Latin America is the key focus of this year's Ambassadors Conference. We share common values with many countries in the region. This is the solid foundation for increased cooperation. Germany should participate in the mood of change and the amazing dynamism to be seen on the continent. The opportunities and potential of enhanced cooperation with Latin America are far from exhausted. I propose an annual meeting of businesspeople and diplomats along the lines of the annual conference of the Asia-Pacific Committee, where we can develop concrete initiatives for increased cooperation with Latin America. We are ready to do this./////We are thinking beyond large-scale natural resources. We know, for example, that a country like Brazil is hugely committed to renewable energies. Here we can contribute German cutting-edge technologies. These are important cooperation projects from which everyone, but especially our partners, will benefit./////Over the next few months and years, I predict, Latin America will come more and more to the fore. The world will be looking to Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. And we saw ourselves with our ""summer fairytale"" just how a major sporting event like that can change a country's image. Suddenly the world realized that we Germans can be cheerful and uninhibited (though we always knew it of ourselves), and that Germany can have good weather (though we know, of course, that that's always the case). Overnight, Germany's image in the world changed completely, as many of you experienced. The same thing happened this summer with South Africa. Think back to everything the esteemed observers and critics wrote before the World Cup; they implied that a World Cup tournament in South Africa was bound to end in crime and murder, that the South Africans were incapable of organizing such an event. But South Africa was a wonderful host and changed the world's view both of that country and of the entire African continent, as I heard recently from Africans themselves at the African Union summit. Major events like these are guaranteed to affect us here: not just because of the sport, but also because they present huge opportunities, for investment for example-from the construction of stadiums to tourism marketing./////At global level German foreign policy is committed to fair framework conditions. We need global institutions which are universally accepted and capable of action. This is true of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as the World Trade Organization. We are approaching the necessary reforms resolutely. On international trade policy in particular, we must throw our entire weight onto the scale to ward off dangers to the world economy from a renewed bout of protectionism. Only free and open markets lead to development and growth. It is very gratifying that the Federal Economics Minister has put this right at the top of his agenda./////I am saying this not least with an eye to a country which is rightly taking up all our attention just now. As we are all aware, the floods in Pakistan in recent weeks have caused unimaginable damage and suffering. We Germans acted quickly to provide effective aid. When I say ""we Germans"", I mean not only the Government and state institutions, but also our citizens, something which is never highly enough appreciated. It means a great deal for our image in the world when our citizens respond so actively and so caringly in such situations. But what happens afterwards? After this immediate humanitarian aid, it is a question of what we can do for a country like Pakistan so that it remains stable, so that it doesn't crumple, collapse in economic terms. Here, again, foreign policy and economic policy need to work together, for example in an initiative I have just launched in Europe to open up channels for trade for products from Pakistan. A not uncontroversial move, as you all know, but presumably more sustainable than the help needed now in the short term but which naturally cannot be viable in the long term./////In this connection the Federal Economics Ministry and the Federal Foreign Office are pulling in the same direction. Rainer Brderle and I have been in complete agreement on this for many years. You'll have realized that we didn't just meet each other for the first time in the Cabinet./////We want to make use of new opportunities for Germany across the world. But we will not be losing sight of our partners right here on our doorstep. And this brings me to the last thought I'd like to share./////Of course we export a lot to East Asian countries and everyone is talking about China and the domestic changes it will have to undergo so that it can be even more important and attractive for us in economic terms. But-and maybe I'll surprise some of you now-Germany still exports more to the Netherlands than it does to China. So I'll just say one thing: we must value Europe. Not merely in economic terms, but especially as the major project for peace, freedom and prosperity on our continent. I say this because Europe is very often spoken of carelessly: Rainer Brderle, other colleagues and I could all tell tales about that. Of course it is unbelievably tiring sometimes to discuss things for hours, sometimes through the night, and to negotiate with countries where you wonder why they're vetoing things and what their interest could be in doing so. Of course it is strenuous to negotiate through the night, but the fact that the European cooperative model replaced the confrontation model that previously existed on our continent is a tremendous historic achievement by those who held positions of responsibility before us. It's better to negotiate through the night than to be at odds with countries on your own continent. Just over ten years ago we still had wars in Europe. Even if Europe had achieved nothing more than several decades of peace on our continent, it would still have been worthwhile./////This, to my mind, is more important than the issue of a single market with almost five hundred million people and the opportunities inherent in the single currency. But I would also say that European integration, the single market and single currency were success stories for Germany in particular, and especially for the German economy. That is why we must work together to promote this European ideal. Europe will only be strong if it is firmly supported by the people of Europe-and ensuring that this is the case is not a matter for policymakers alone./////Reliability must be the trademark of European economic and financial policy too. This means rigorous rules for swift debt reduction and on new borrowing. And these rules must actually be enforced. Anyone who ignores the joint responsibility, persists in reporting false figures, manipulates statistics, becomes overindebted, does not budget in a sound, serious manner, cannot simply get away with it in Europe. This applies to both small and large countries. This applies to others and also to us. The Stability and Growth Pact needs an automatic sanctions regime so that whenever anyone violates the joint responsibility it will have immediate consequences. I am firmly convinced of this and negotiations must take place on this now. It is in the interests of all euro states committed to a healthy euro, and anyone not sticking to the rules must not be allowed to get any more money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to all, no matter how big or powerful a country might be in Europe. We want a European Union of responsibility and we are enthusiastic Europeans, but what we don't want is a transfer union in Europe where basically everyone can behave irresponsibly without repercussions. That is not on. Anyone wishing to protect Europe will have to change the rules on this./////You all know that foreign and domestic policy are becoming ever more closely interlinked. You see this in the climate debate and also, for instance, in what we discussed yesterday with the Foreign Minister of Mexico./////I am delighted at and congratulate the Federal Economics Minister on the successful negotiations on energy policy and of course on the fact that a rational energy mix has been agreed. This is also of great significance for foreign policy, and here I come to the close. It is of course true that we discuss energy policy from the point of view of environmental protection and climate change, subjects we will shortly be considering in Cancun in Mexico. But energy policy is more than just a question of ecology, economics or the affordability of energy; rather, it is also a question of our foreign-policy sovereignty. If we make ourselves too dependent on one energy supplier, we are making ourselves not only economically dependent but also politically impressionable. And that is something we must always bear in mind. If we want to retain our sovereignty in foreign policy, then we have to acknowledge that our economy is best based on an energy mix. Hence the decisions of yesterday and the day before. I believe this to be right; energy policy, more than virtually any other field, shows just how interlinked foreign policy and economic policy really are./////Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to hearing what the Federal Economics Minister has to say to us.//////////",0.1
Armed Conflict,    04.06.2010 - Speech,Opening address by Minister of State Werner Hoyer at the meeting of the Friends of Yemen working group - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Dear Co-Chair, dear Khaled Al Ghaith,dear Mohy Abdullah Al Dhabbi,Excellencies,dear Colleagues, dear Friends,/////It gives me great pleasure to welcome all of you here in Berlin at the second meeting of the Working Group on Economy and Governance of the Friends of Yemen. The challenges this Working Group has been asked to address are formidable ones./////For me and for my country, Germany, it is an honour and a privilege to host and to co-chair this meeting together with our Emirati partners, in close collaboration with our friends from Yemen, and building on the active participation and contributions of an impressively large number of countries and organisations gathered around this table today./////All of you are well aware of that./////Yemen faces a serious risk of destabilization./////If not properly addressed, several stress factors can easily impact negatively on the prospects of development for the country and also have consequences beyond the borders of Yemen://///Yemen is facing severe interior conflicts, up to the point of threatening the unity and integrity of the country. The armed conflict with the Houthi rebels in the North was put on hold with a truce in February this year. This was an achievement which was greeted by all of us. But the root causes of the conflict remain to be addressed. Yet, on another front, a separatist movement in the South is rallying support. This is a threat which we have to take seriously. Again, healing the rifts between North and South will only come if there is an opportunity to tackle the root causes of the divide. As a German politician, I am fully aware of the challenges of what we have labelled the necessity to accomplish the unity of a country after unification./////An increasingly deteriorating economic situation is another area of serious concern. With dwindling revenues from the oil economy, the Government lacks more and more the funds it needs to ensure fulfilment of its basic functions for the people. Changes towards a more sustainable and broader economic basis are desperately needed. Yemen is one of the poorest nations in the Arab world. Much of the population lives on less than a few dollars a day. With unemployment widening and the population growing, today's perspectives for making a living tomorrow are slim. Yemen therefore knows it needs to invest in education and job opportunities to give its people a perspective for the future./////In view of this situation, the ""Friends of Yemen"" have gathered in London early this year in order to try to address the challenges in a joint effort./////Allow me to take the opportunity to briefly share with you my personal reading of what the ""Friends of Yemen"" process is about./////The starting point of the ""Friends of Yemen"" is the understanding that the challenges Yemen is facing are challenges to all of us - to Yemen and its people first and foremost, but also to the Region, in particular to the neighbouring countries, the countries on the Arabian Peninsula, and also to the International Community in general./////Stabilizing Yemen, so the core message, is primarily about Yemen and the Yemeni people. But it is also about preventing the spread of instability and its negative impact into the region and beyond the region./////""Friends of Yemen"" is not about money. It is not yet another donor conference. It is mainly about generating political commitment in Yemen and outside Yemen to address and to try to resolve the most pressing issues in a joint effort./////""Friends of Yemen"" have based their work on a common understanding of a couple of guiding principles./////First, Yemeni ownership and Yemeni responsibility. Yemen is in the drivers seat for its own reform agenda. International partners stand ready to encourage, advise and support, but should by no means attempt to impose a foreign agenda of whatever kind or nature. It is Yemen, its leadership and ultimately its people who have to grasp the opportunities offered in that process for more stability, prosperity and legitimacy. International support will have to build on and to rely on progress in implementing reform by Yemenis within Yemen./////That means on the other hand that the ""Friends of Yemen"" process will go nowhere unless there is a firm commitment by the Yemeni leadership to implement necessary reforms, even in the face of possible popular rejection./////Whoever carries the burden of political responsibility in times of crisis knows how tough the choices can become eventually./////Even in wealthy Europe, the effort of stabilizing ailing economies within the Eurozone comes with the implementation of reform, occasionally with austerity measures which are all but popular with the electorate and which require political courage and determination for those who bear responsibility in the political arena./////Allow me to point out in this context that we heard with a certain degree of concern the news that the recent round of consultations between Yemen and the IMF has apparently not produced an agreement on how to proceed with regard to a possible IMF programme for Yemen. As you all know, such a programme has already been identified in London as being of particular importance. Let me express my hope that Yemen and the IMF will continue their efforts to come to terms in order to conclude an agreement on a possible programme./////Second, regional cooperation and integration. We all acknowledge the paramount importance of the direct neighbours of Yemen with regard to the stabilization efforts. ""Friends of Yemen"" have from the start reserved a very special role for the regional actors, mainly for the neighbours of Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Their perceptions, their recommendations, their contributions are of critical relevance for the success of the process./////I would also like to add a very personal remark, at the risk of being accused of continuing to foster a hopelessly romantic and eurocentristic world view: For me as a politician, whose home base has been Europe and the political project of European integration, I firmly believe in the beneficial effects of closer regional integration for peace and prosperity of those involved. Europe is a very telling example that in politics, the logic of zero-sum-games is certainly not the most fruitful perspective at hand. Far-sighted politicians in Europe understood the message of two World Wars which started on the European Continent: That less can become more, that integrating, giving up on the right to exercise sovereign decisions can become the most prominent avenue to peace and to prosperity./////It is also against this background that we support the Yemeni quest for closer regional integration and that we are heartened by the efforts of the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council to identify sectors and areas where integration of Yemen into GCC structures can be reinforced. We would like to encourage you to continue to explore this avenue further./////Third, the support of the International Community./////""Friends of Yemen"" are, not to a lesser extent, the ""Friends of Yemen"" within the international community. In our much too often media-driven political agendas, intricate challenges like the ones we are facing in Yemen, are in danger to be overlooked. They are simply too complex for simple narratives or for quick fixes. ""Friends of Yemen"" is in my view also about mobilizing political attention and political commitment for the political, economic, social and governance challenges Yemen is facing within the international community./////The Working Methods this Working Group has given itself tell a story worth noting: Partners and Friends have agreed to join hands, to join forces and to contribute, each one in the field of their foremost expertise, to a process shared by all./////Allow me to express my sincere gratitude and the gratitude of my government, and I am confident to speak also on behalf on my co-chair, the UAE, for the readiness of the participants of this Working Group to make significant contributions to the work of the Group./////In this spirit of a joint endeavour and a shared responsibility, I wish you fruitful exchanges. We all need a successful outcome of your deliberations./////",0.2
Armed Conflict,    18.11.2010 - Interview,"Foreign Minister Westerwelle in an interview with Financial Times on the NATO's Strategic Concept, Afghanistan und the situation in the eurozone - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"Source: www.ft.comQuestion: Looking to the Nato summit in Lisbon, are you satisfied with the newstrategic concept, or do you want further amendments?Foreign Minister Westerwelle: Some of Germany's core concerns have been taken into account.The proposals made by the Nato secretary-general are a very good basis. Itis clear that Nato sees itself as a political union of values, and also asa defence alliance it supports the need for disarmament and nuclearnonproliferation. The invitation to Russia to take part in a missiledefence system is of historic importance. The fact that President Medvedevwants to go to Lisbon shows how important that invitation is to Russia. Inmy conversations in Moscow with the Russian government, especially withForeign Minister Lavrov, I got the clear impression that they want to studythe details objectively. That alone is huge progress. I can´t anticipatethe speech of President Medvedev. But look, 20 years after Europe wasreunited after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall, Nato is making an offer toRussia to take part in a defence and security project. There are threepossible responses: to reject it out of hand; to accept it unchecked; or toengage in constructive discussions. That Russia has decided on the thirdway is very welcome.Question: Will the allies themselves agree?Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.Question: Do you think that agreement on a missile defence system will openthe way to further nuclear disarmament?The American government under President Obama has set thecourse with its nuclear posture review. That reduces the strategicimportance of nuclear weapons. As long as there are nuclear weapons in theworld, we in our defence alliance will have to rely on nuclear deterrence.But the way to a nuclear free world depends on confidence-building throughnuclear and other forms of disarmament. After a decade of setbacks fordisarmament, our initiatives seemed to be little more than a trickle. Nowwe´ve got a considerable tide moving. /////In New York we founded a group ofstates from all regions of the world that feel particularly committed tothe goals of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation - Japan, Australiaand Germany are in the lead. And this time the nuclear non-proliferationconference in New York was a success, unlike when it last met five yearsago. The new Start treaty has been agreed. We are counting on its beingratified by the US and Russia. So the debate over nuclear zero is in fullflow round the world. Why are disarmament and nuclear disarmament soimportant? Because they are a commitment that gives us the authority todemand nuclear non-proliferation (from others). Disarmament and nuclearnon-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. If we in the West, if thenuclear powers, disarm, then they will be much more credible in insistingthat other states should not acquire nuclear weapons.Question: But the Americans do not wish to withdraw their medium-rangemissiles from Germany, as you want.I can only respect and applaud the American government forgiving momentum to the disarmament debate. The vision of a nuclear zerowhich the American president talked about in his outstanding speech inPrague is now part of that debate. And that is why I am very happy aboutthe close partnership both with the USA and in particular with my Americancounterpart Hillary Clinton. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is basedon three pillars.1.Anyone can use nuclear energy if they are committed to internationaltransparencyand co-operation.2.The nuclear powers will disarm, so that3.the international community can demand with special authority that no oneelse arms themselves with nuclear weapons.Question: Do you not have a problem with France over your desire to have anarms control committee set up within Nato, while the French want to stressthe importance of nuclear weapons in the new strategic doctrine?/////I would not describe it as a problem, but rather as anecessary discussion in preparation for convergence of different,historically based points of view. France has been a nuclear power fordecades, just like Britain, and naturally has a different attitude when itcomes to the role of nuclear weapons to what we have for example inGermany. We have learned the lessons of our history. But at the G8 summitin 2009, France also recognised the goal of a world without nuclearweapons. So the fct that we need to discuss the question is perfectlynormal. /////We are 28 Nato member states, and naturally they need to bringtheir different positions closer together. Let me tell you straight out:the Nato strategic concept will protect our common security interests, andaddress new challenges, stress our community of values, and - reallyrevolutionary for a defence alliance - also emphasise the role ofdisarmament for global security. Every concept sets a goal and at the sametime amounts to an agreement on common action. That is why it is astrategic concept. The last Nato concept was agreed in 1999. After Lisbonyou should just do one thing: look at the old concept of 1999 beside thenew concept. I am sure that the role of disarmament will clearly be givenmore weight.Question: Is there not a danger that this new concept will push Nato in thedirection of become a global policeman. Am I justified in fearing that?We are sticking to the core commitment of Nato in Article V.That means we will defend ourselves in the case of any armed attack. We arenot going to water that down. But it is equally clear that everything Natodoes in the future will be in accordance with international law. Ourbehaviour is in accordance with international law. /////There are certainly newthreats that have arisen that we did not foresee in previous years, such asterrorist threats, or the danger of the spread of weapons of massdestruction. That should not just be considered from the point of view ofstates arming themselves and therefore making whole regions unstable. Ontop of that, the more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the greateris the danger of terrorist groups or other criminal organisations gettingtheir hands on nuclear weapons potential. And 20 people with one atom bombis an army.Question: But is it the job of Nato to find these people and destroy them?We have been fighting together against terrorism for a longtime, including on the instructions of the United Nations. We and many ofthe other Nato member states are in Afghanistan with a UN mandate. That wasthe difference with the war in Iraq. We are in Afghanistan on the basis ofa Un decision, clearly based on international law.Question: Is Gaza the sort of place you can see Nato operating in apeacekeeping capacity?/////I think that regional conflict resolution must stem from theparties to the conflict, and above all must be supported by the UN. The UNis an organisation, especially the Security Council, that gets involvedaround the world in the solution of regional conflicts and the promotion ofregional stability. In my view, the UN role cannot be replaced by any othersort of defence alliance.Question: But when is a terrorist attack part of a regional conflict, and whenis it an attack on Nato itself?You can´t say that abstractly or theoretically. One must judgeon a caseby- case basis. What we are working on is conflict prevention,above all else.Question: That is an integral part of it. The new strategic concept is part ofthe worldwide reaction to September 11_and a great deal more. We have so many new challenges. Thedanger of weapons of mass destruction, the danger of computer attacks,so-called asymmetric threats. And moreover, we haven´t just got Article V,we also have Article IV, for example regarding consultation in thealliance.Question: You have talked of computer wars, and I must confess that I amastonished that this strategic concept does not attempt to change Article Vto allow for mutual defence against computer attacks.The debates will only take place when we get to Lisbon. Wemight as well give up the summit if I tell you about the whole concept now!Question: But how are we going to deal with computer wars, how can we organiseourselves against them? As you said, that is one of the big new dangers. Wealready saw that in Estonia and in Georgia, and interestingly most recentlyin Iran. What should the Nato summit do to defend us all against thisdanger?Well that is precisely the sort of question which requiresinternational co-operation, even beyond Nato. I am no technical expert, andalso no computer specialist who can give you a practical answer. We havealso had a thorough discussion of this in our federal government, what weshould do against such computer attacks. In American or British English youseem to speak very easily of war. I would avoid that. You speak of war_Question: Like cyber war_Precisely, and I speak rather of computer attacks, because theword war is more easily and frequently used in English. You have a waragainst climate change, don´t you?Question: Yes.In English one talks rather easily about a war against this orthat. In Germany we are very cautious about using the word war. That is whywe don´t speak of a computer war, but of computer attacks.Question: Or of armed conflicts?Certainly not! We are speaking of attacks. The precisetranslation simply has another resonance, the meaning is more loaded. It´sno wonder. I am speaking of computer attacks, and we will naturally alsodiscuss these questions. That is why I pointed out that we don´t just haveArticle V. There are also further questions of cooperation andconsultation, that is all part of it.Question: But in Estonia the whole financial and government system came undercomputer attacks. And Estonia was already a Nato member, but Nato could notdo anything about it.Perhaps so, because we must first become more technicallycompetent to defend with such new challenges. But that is not the job ofheads of state and government, or for foreign ministers, or even defenceministers. We have to agree on a strategy. We determine that there is achallenge that concerns our security, and then naturally we must talk aboutthe details of how we find an appropriate answer, which should beproportional, efficient and focussed.Question: If it is clear that such attacks come from Russia, how is itpossible to have a closer cooperation with the Russians?I know of suspicions, but no proof.Question: Can I ask you about Afghanistan? It is clear that the Germanpopulation is not enthusiastic about this ""armed conflict"". How long canyou ensure the population still supports your involvement? How long can youstay in the country?In Lisbon we will begin the process of handing overresponsibility, by making it clear that next year we will hand overresponsibility for security to Afghanistan and Afghan authorities in thefirst provinces. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to have handedover responsibility for security entirely to the Afghan government during2014. /////So we are opening up a perspective of withdrawal. If we begin to handover responsibility for security in the coming months, that should not beconfused with beginning a troop withdrawal, but as a precondition formaking our withdrawal possible one day in the future.Question: The Americans say that we Europeans do not do enough to convince ourvoters that this war is worthwhile. Is the future of Nato itself notendangered by the war in Afghanistan?I see a lot of shadows and many setbacks - especially with thesecurity situation. But I also see some light and many good developments.Take the elections, which are part of good governance: Naturally theelections are rightly criticised because of attempts at manipulation, butthe good thing is what is happening from Afghanistan itself. It isimportant progress that the first mandates that were awarded because ofmanipulation at the count were immediately cancelled. These were the firstelections in Afghanistan that took place under Afghan supervision. Therewas not only higher voter participation, but also a lot of complaints fromthe population itself, from Afghans themselves, and the Afghan authoritiesdrew their conclusions. They cancelled elections that were won throughmanipulation, and that is remarkable. /////I find it healthy that Germans have afundamentally sceptical attitude towards foreign (military) deployments.That is because of the dreadful first half of the last century. At the sametime, Germans live up to their international responsibility in an exemplaryfashion, considering for example that they are the third largest supplierof international troops. /////Both parties in the government have stated thatthey support the intervention in Afghanistan, and they have a majority forthat view. The same people who are inwardly sceptical about foreignmilitary interventions - which I find a justified view - have alsorecognised the necessity and given those parties a big majority insupporting the Afghan intervention. Both poles shape our foreign policy:the culture of military restraint, and at the same time, the recognition ofour international responsibility. Germany is an excellent model in that.Question: Has Germany changed in the past 20 years, since unification? Iremember Helmut Kohl saying he could not conceive of a German soldierserving in the Balkans.Yes. Germany has changed since reunification. This process hasbeen strenuously thought through both in society and in the democraticprocess. If you think of our engagement in the western Balkans, that´s agood example of how successful the intervention of our soldiers can by instabilising the situation, for we were able to reduce our troop numbers inKFOR massively, from 8,500 to just 2,500 today. /////In the meantime, President Tadic has worked through a policy changetowards Kosovo. In Vukovar, in Croatia, he made a remarkable speechapologising for the massacre committed by Serbian troops. /////So things are moving in the right direction there. Iwould also mention the fight against pircy. The impression is given thereas if it was just a question of economic interests. If it´s a question ofprotecting our shipping ands therefore ensuring that aid can get to Africa.That was the starting point of the exercise, and it is succeeding.Question: But in terms of power projection internationally, do you thinkGermans really believe in it? Or will there be a great battle in societyover every future military intervention, wherever it may be?I have just said I am happy that we have a healthy scepticismtowards military interventions of the Bundeswehr. There is nothing wrongwith that. Some foreign politicians may see it as a lack of firmness, butonly if they have not really studied the darkest chapter in our history.Unlike most of our alliance partners, we have a parliamentary army. Thatmeans that every foreign intervention must be approved by our parliament -with a proposal from the government, but decided by the parliament. All ourfriends in the world should be happy that Germany has drawn its lessonsfrom history, and not just in the federal constitution, with its principleof a parliamentary army rather than a government army, but also it is avital element in society, given the readiness both to take internationalresponsibility, and to have a healthy scepticism and a culture of militaryrestraint that lies deep in the hearts of our people. I am proud of boththings.Question: In Brussels many people are saying that Germany has also changed itsattitude towards Europe since reunification - that Germany is more insistent on itsnational interests, and has become very tough in the whole saga of theeurozone crisis. What would you say about that?/////In the preamble of the constitution of the German FederalRepublic stand the two core principles of its foreign policy: to servepeace in the world in a united Europe. Because of that, Germany won a twothirds majority outright in the UN, against two very respectablecandidates, in the first vote (for a seat on the Security Council), becausewe have made multilateralism and European integration our politicalprinciples. /////In my first year as foreign minister I visited all the Europeanmember states, and not just big France and Britain, or Poland, Italy andSpain, but also others like Luxembourg, the three Baltic states and Malta.We regard our European policy as a partnership on the same level for allmember states, whether they are bigger or smaller, and whether they areeconomically more successful or unfortunately for a while rather lesssuccessful.Question: But what about this agreement in Deauville between France andGermany: all the rest had to fall in with it. Don´t you think you stressyour relationship with France too much in an enlarged EU?At the very beginning of my time in office, I revived theso called Weimar triangle. That is the close partnership between France,Poland and Germany. This Weimar triangle has become an important motor inthe EU, alongside the close partnership between France and Germany that hasgrown up over decades.Question: But the eurozone is different?As far as the stability culture is concerned we have manyallies precisely amongst those who joined the EU in the last years.Question: But the Poles weren´t happy about the Deauville deal with France.What counts is what was finally agreed.Question: Are you happy with that?/////I am happy that the Chancellor was able to successfullynegotiate what we agreed in the cabinet after Deauville would be thenegotiating mandate. Three points are most important. First, thatviolations of responsible budget planning do not remain unpunished, andpolitical opportunism must as far as possible not interfere with impositionof sanctions. /////I am one of those who, as a member of the opposition in theBundestag, criticised the relaxation of the stability pact-at Germany´sinstigation - in 2004/5 as a historic mistake. Unfortunately the partiesthat were in government then, and are now in opposition, have refused tosupport the solution to the problems caused by their own mistaken decision.Second, the creation of a crisis mechanism, which will not be a (EU)community instrument, because that would mean creating a form of legalliability that would not be acceptable in our German legal system. /////Third, we do not want to relieve private creditors of their responsibility.Those who bet against countries, and loses those bets, and yet can gohome with their profits untouched, they won´t be let off. That must change.Question: Do you agree with the Chancellor that if the Euro fails, then Europewill fail?/////Neither the euro, nor Europe, will fail. That is why theChancellor and I as foreign minister are working for its success. I am aEuropean patriot.Question: What does that mean?It means that I am one of the first politicians in the countrywho is happy to say publicly that I am proud of my country - and that waslong before the World Cup in 2006. I see Germany as embedded in a Europe ofvalues and co-operation. For me Europe is much more than a common currency,and far more than a system to ensure our welfare at a time ofglobalisation, much more than an internal market and the freedom to travel./////For me, Europe is a community of values. It is a political union thatserves both peace and freedom. Therefore the euro is a currency of freedom,and not just a means of exchange. The European model of co-operation isdemanding, arduous, nerve-wracking even, and the negotiations often go onall night. And the European model of co-operation also costs money,although a lot less than it would cost to eliminate the sort of conflictsthat regularly occurred in past centuries. The model of co-operation hastaken over from the model of confrontation. And that is an unbelievablegood fortune for our generation. You are sitting here in a building aroundwhich everything was bombed to bits in the war. You are sitting in a placethat was the source of oppression in a socialist dictatorship. In one hourby car you can be in Poland, and there are no more border conflicts. /////For the first time since Germany existed, it is surrounded by friendly stateswho have organised themselves under a single European roof. Anyone who doesnot love Europe can´t be helped. They´re just thoughtless. If you takeEurope for granted, then you will begin to lose it, and that isextraordinarily dangerous. I see disturbing tendencies towardsrenationalisation, regrettably both in Europe and in many countries of theworld. But it is our task to oppose this tendency wherever it may be found.Question: But I read some awful articles in Bild Zeitung about Greece earlierthis year. That worried me a bit.I ask you: there are always debates and bad ideas, in bar-roomconversations and in the media, but we are talking now about responsiblepolicy. You must have a clear compass, and mine has one clear co-ordinate,and that is Europe.Question: One last question: were you not rather disappointed that PresidentObama said in Delhi that he supported India´s desire to become a permanentmember of the UN Security Council? He has never said it about Germany.President Obama was speaking to the Indian and not the Germanparliament. If he had not supported India for the Security Council in hisspeech, it would have been a strange omission. I expect that he will make asimilarly friendly remark in Japan, where he is going at the end of theweek.Question: And then you´ll invite him to the Bundestag?When he next has time to visit Germany I will be delighted tohear the friendly words that President Obama, a man I greatly admire, willfind for both Brazil and Germany./////(The questions were posed by Quentin Peel and Gerritt Wiesmann)//////////",0.1
Armed Conflict,    06.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle at the opening of the Ambassadors Conference at the Federal Foreign Office - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advence text __/////Esteemed Colleague,/////Excellencies,/////Members of the German Bundestag,/////Guests and friends of the Federal Foreign Office,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I bid you a warm welcome to this year's conference of heads of German missions abroad./////It's a special pleasure for me to welcome my Mexican colleague Patricia Espinosa Cantellano as today's guest of honour. Many of you know her as a former ambassador to our country, as a friend of Germany and of the German language. We're very pleased to have you here!/////Ladies and gentlemen, during the past few months I've visited many of you in your missions. Some of you are here for the first time. I'm looking forward to discussing the direction and focuses of German foreign policy with you over the next few days./////Our work is often determined by our unsettled world's current crises and conflicts. It's therefore all the more important to have a clear view of the long-term challenges. For that reason I want to concentrate today on the three major priorities I see for German foreign policy and which we've already made serious efforts to tackle in past months://///First, shaping globalization through values-based and interest-oriented policies./////Second, a German peace and security policy built around disarmament and non-proliferation, in close cooperation with our allies and partners./////Third, strengthening and advancing European integration as the foundation of German foreign policy./////I./////If we want to shape globalization we need like-minded partners. Four weeks ago the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America concept. Latin America is the focus of this first Ambassadors Conference to be held during my term in office. I'm well aware that some people derided this choice at the beginning, but those who, like me, have experienced this continent's spirit of renewal and fantastic dynamism, as well as its affinity to Europe, will know what opportunities and potential this region possesses./////A German foreign policy that sees itself as both values-based and interest-oriented has always set its sights on both aspects. As a major trading nation we must have the big picture of global dynamism. This is why, during my first months in office, I travelled to China, Russia and Africa. In a few weeks' time we will on behalf of the Federal Government present a new Africa concept designed to revamp our policy towards this continent, too./////This October I will visit India./////However, I also visited Latin America because I see these countries as our natural partners in shaping globalization. Latin America is characterized to a greater extent than other regions outside the ""West"" by the values of the European Enlightenment. We share the values of individual liberty and the rule of law with most countries in this region./////Over the coming months and years Latin America will increasingly become the focus of attention. This November, in Cancun in Mexico, we will renew our efforts towards international climate protection. Mexico will take over the chair of the G20 from our French neighbours. In 2014 during the FIFA World Cup, and during the 2016 Olympic Games, the eyes of the world will be on Brazil. Latin America is a multi-faceted continent, and we want to help it find solutions to its most pressing issues, such as internal security. But above all I want to focus attention on the huge opportunities and the political and social potential which lie in closer relations with Latin America./////We need strong partners like Latin America so that we can back up the globalization of markets with the globalization of values./////To give globalization a human face we need a strong United Nations in line with 21st century reality. The greater significance of the Southern countries must be reflected in the Security Council. We're working for a reform of the Security Council to ensure that Africa and Latin America are also permanently represented./////Germany is facing up to its responsibility in the UN. While a permanent seat on the Security Council is our long-term policy aim, Germany is currently standing for non-permanent membership of the Council for 2011 and 2012./////Our election campaign is making good progress. With your daily work you are creating the trust your host countries' governments place in Germany, and for this I thank you. Keep up this good work so that we will have the majority we need during the elections in the General Assembly in mid October!/////Global trade isn't what's new about globalization-we've had that for centuries. The new factor is time, the incredible speed with which it takes place. As late as the 19th century major economic and social changes often took 50 years to happen. Today maybe 15 or 20 years can decide whether nations rise or fall./////A nation's wealth is no longer mainly its raw materials. Education is becoming more and more important. Knowledge arises from hard work, not from geological coincidence. We need more education out of respect for the generations to come. Children don't need good schools so that they do well in the PISA test, they need schools so that they can make the best use of their talents and live life to the fullest./////It's also a question of our society's competitiveness. We need good schools and universities to hold our own in the global competition for the brightest students. Only if our universities remain attractive can we keep our high flyers in Germany, only then will we encourage gifted young people from other countries to study here./////In this case, too, interests and values interact. Those who return home after studying here maintain links with Germany and disseminate our values in their own countries. Our cultural relations and education policy makes Germany more competitive, while at the same time helping to globalize our values./////An active cultural relations and education policy isn't a luxury but wise and far-sighted. Partner schools and Goethe-Institute, university partnerships and the promotion of talented young people are elements of a foreign and globalization policy which is in Germany's vested interests./////Latin America gives us many examples of such cooperation. Together with Chile and Colombia we have set up Centres of Excellence. In São Paulo, the largest German business community abroad, a German Science and Innovation Forum is being created. In Buenos Aires we will open a German-Argentinian University Centre and a Max Planck Partner Institute. In Mexico there are German professorships./////Dear colleague, you are living proof of Germany's cultural relations and education policy. I first met Patricia Espinosa Cantellano this April. She went to the German School in Mexico, speaks excellent German, and was her country's ambassador in Berlin and Vienna. Our shared language and access to culture links us and enables us to cooperate to the benefit of both our countries./////Mexico and Germany are ideal partners in the quest for values-based globalization. During the next few months, dear colleague, you can count on our support in making the Cancun climate summit a success under your chairmanship./////Education policy is just one example of the extent to which our country's influence abroad depends on our performance at home. Domestic and foreign policy are becoming increasingly interlinked. Only an economically strong country can have sufficient foreign-policy clout./////It's therefore important not only from a domestic-policy but also from a foreign-policy standpoint that we take the right road in the financial and economic crisis. The Federal Government's budget cuts are painful, also for the Federal Foreign Office, but if we use our budget wisely Germany will in the medium term have more, rather than less, of a role to play on the foreign policy stage./////II./////The second key priority is a German security and peace policy that is in keeping with the times./////On a current note, let me first say that Germany will do everything in its power to help ensure success of the direct talks that have just begun between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is the two sides that have to make peace with one another. That we cannot do for them. But we will continue to do all we can to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. The first German-Palestinian Steering Committee that met this spring in Berlin has taken our cooperation with the Palestinians to a new level. This close cooperation has met with strong approval not only in the Arab world, but also in Israel. That is important to us-because the security and bright future of Israel is and will remain a fundamental pillar of German policy./////At the beginning of this government's term of office, there was a need to reshape Germany's engagement in Afghanistan. We have done a level-headed and honest stocktaking./////This included reassessing the operation and determining that, from an international humanitarian law perspective, it is an armed conflict. On this basis, we have drawn up a strategy that, first, realistically defines our objectives, second, brings deployment of our military and civilian assets in line with these objectives and, third, clearly highlights the need for a political solution./////The mission in Afghanistan is certainly not popular. But it remains necessary, and it serves our core security interests. Looking at the country today, it still presents a mixed picture with more and less encouraging developments. Yet in recent months we have achieved a great deal, and we want to continue our steady progress down this path./////At the London Conference in January, we closely coordinated our strategy both within NATO and with the international community./////We have markedly increased our presence in Afghanistan at all levels. I would like to extend to the diplomats, service members, police officers and reconstruction workers my deep respect and gratitude for the duties they are performing there for our country, in very difficult conditions./////A few weeks ago in Kabul, we set out a roadmap. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 18 September, and they are the first to be organized under sole Afghan responsibility. This November at the NATO Summit in Lisbon, we will be taking a decision on whether to hand over security responsibility in several regions of the country./////By 2014, we want to have transferred security responsibility for the entire country to the Government of Afghanistan, in line with President Karzai's objective./////By following this roadmap, we are creating the real prospect for a withdrawal of our women and men in uniform, and for an Afghanistan in which Afghan women and men once again will take charge of their own destiny. Yet our benchmark remains that a threat to international security must no longer emanate from Afghanistan./////Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan is key to stabilizing the entire region. The flooding in recent weeks has caused unthinkable destruction and human suffering./////We have provided rapid and effective assistance; beyond the humanitarian aid offered during the initial weeks, we will remain engaged in reconstruction and political reform efforts. Pakistan deserves to be a special focus of our attention, on both a humanitarian and political level./////Despite these crises that we are facing right now, we must not lose sight of the long-term security and peace policy challenges. On Sunday, we will mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the 2+4 Treaty, a masterpiece of foreign policy and a milestone on the path to German unity. This is a fitting occasion to thank our partners and allies in the transatlantic community for helping bring about a Germany that is united and free./////The Alliance remains the foundation of our security. But the world has changed in fundamental ways. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a significant increase in the nuclear threat due to the proliferation of weapons and missile technology. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons poses one of the greatest threats to our security. Mitigating this development is a question of survival. Disarmament is therefore not a 1980s issue, and it is not a pipe dream; rather, in our globalized world, it is a necessity./////The conclusion of a new START Treaty between Russia and the United States marked the encouraging beginning to a decade that must become a decade of disarmament./////At the NPT Review Conference held in New York last May, tactical nuclear weapons were for the first time included in the disarmament effort, which was a success for the policies of this Federal Government and the German Bundestag./////It is our aim, on the one hand, to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and, on the other hand, to reduce the existing stockpiles of these weapons. These are two sides of the same coin. That is why the controversy surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme goes far beyond its regional implications; it is in fact a global issue./////We are going to great lengths to ensure that disarmament and arms control will remain a key issue, also within NATO's new Strategic Concept that is to be adopted at the Lisbon Summit in November. This will create the opportunity for us to devise a truly cooperative security architecture for all of Europe, expressly including Russia. The initiative presented by myself together with the Foreign Ministers of the Benelux countries and Norway at the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Tallinn last April regarding the reduced significance of nuclear weapons within NATO served this same purpose./////In the long term, we remain committed to President Obama's Global Zero vision, that is a world without nuclear weapons. We have quite a long way to go. But in formulating our policy, we will not lose sight of this goal./////Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction already on their own pose a great threat to us all. We must do everything within our power to prevent them from entering unholy alliances, and their becoming a curse brought about by globalization./////III./////Probably the greatest challenge, but also the most rewarding task, of German foreign policy is the construction of Europe./////A united Europe is the foundation on which German foreign policy rests. Europe is not everything, but without Europe everything is nothing./////In May, we needed to take two consecutive, very difficult decisions to shield the euro-and thus Europe-from a severe crisis. These difficult weeks made it clear to all of us that European integration must be fought for again and again. It is not a permanent condition. It is also not ""irreversible"". Eurobarometer public opinion polls point to a dramatic drop in Europe's approval rating in Germany. I am deeply worried about this, but I am also highly determined to work for, and champion the cause of, the construction of Europe. I ask you all to join me in this effort./////For us Germans, a united Europe is not some luxury that we could, if need be, do without. It guarantees our prosperity, our peace and our freedom./////To keep it this way, we Europeans must make progress on reducing deficits, and we must put in place strict rules governing new borrowing. This is the only option for restoring sound growth to Europe. It is obviously in all EU member states' own interest to keep the euro healthy. Stability of the euro is everyone's responsibility. If anyone opts out of our common responsibility for Europe, this must automatically have consequences in the form of sanctions./////Rule violators should be barred from receiving money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to everyone, no matter how large or powerful a European country it may be. We want a European Union of responsibility, and not one of transfer payments, where a country can shirk responsibility and hope for a bailout. These are our objectives in ongoing negotiations within the van Rompuy led group./////Strengthening cohesion within the European Union is dear to my heart. For a strong and united Europe, we want to reinforce ties with partners to our east as much as to our west, ties that have been nurtured over decades. My first trip abroad as Foreign Minister was to Warsaw. Germany's relations with France and with Poland are both top priority. Here, there is no ""either _ or"", it is always an ""and""./////We have successfully reactivated the Weimar Triangle. It is becoming a driving force of European policy./////During my first year in office, I visited European member states regardless of their population size-because the European project has no use for sorting countries according to their importance; rather, all member states must stand as one./////Only on the basis of this internal cohesion can we use Europe's international clout to our advantage. In the coming days, we will hold intensive discussions in Brussels about Europe's relations with strategic partners such as China and India./////During my recent travels to Turkey and the Western Balkan countries, I saw that the European project for peace and prosperity remains as attractive as ever. In these countries, the prospect of drawing closer to the EU is probably the strongest factor driving reform./////In all of this we must, however, be certain that our citizens stand behind our policies. Europe is only strong when its citizens support the construction of Europe and recognize the truly inestimable value it holds for our country./////Before I ask my Mexican colleague to take the floor, I want to address an issue that many of my co workers here at this ministry have been giving much thought to, namely the future of our foreign service./////The world is constantly changing, regardless of our need to save money. Across the globe, power is shifting. We must closely examine and adapt how we use our resources. At the same time, we are in the process of establishing a European External Action Service./////This will cause some of you to wince and say that, in your area, efficiencies have been maximized, changes and savings are simply not possible. My answer to this is, you must view this situation as an opportunity./////Continual change is one of the few constant factors of diplomatic life. Just as you have done for yourself, the Federal Foreign Office must develop an institutional culture of change. Who would know better than you which changes are required? Let me thank all Foreign Office staff, from local staff to ambassadors, who have contributed to the fruitful discussions on our intranet ""forum for the future""./////We will discuss the results during this Ambassadors Conference, for one thing. But the project ""AA 2020"" will continue, so that the Foreign Office will remain ready and able to lead German foreign policy./////In the diplomacy business, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. Crises, whether natural disasters or man made, are not predictable./////We require structures that can quickly adapt to changes. Above all, we need staff who find the right solutions in unusual situations. During the ten months that I have been in office, I have again and again been reaffirmed in my view that Foreign Office staff do great work and effectively promote our country's interests abroad. I know that their efforts are also highly respected in the German Bundestag./////Please take my thanks back to your missions, pass it on to your colleagues, and especially also to their families and partners./////For centuries, Germans have found a new home in Latin America, where they have seized opportunities and achieved success. Today we are partners in globalization. I am pleased about our long-standing, close ties with Mexico that are based on trust, and I now have the honour to hand the floor over to the Secretary of Foreign Relations of the United Mexican States./////Dear Colleague, dear Patricia, over to you./////",0.1
Armed Conflict,    18.08.2010 - Press release,Life-saving work in mortal danger-Federal Minister Westerwelle on World Humanitarian Day - Federal Foreign Office ,humanitarian aid,"Whether it be the earthquake in Haiti at the start of the year or the devastating floods in Pakistan, millions of people around the world are dependent on humanitarian aid to survive. At the same time, missions are getting ever more dangerous for those providing assistance./////On the occasion of World Humanitarian Day, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (19 August)://///""German humanitarian aid happens where it is needed most. It is an expression of our solidarity with the victims of natural disasters and armed conflicts. The sole aim of our assistance is to save and preserve lives, alleviate suffering and ensure those affected get their dignity back./////My gratitude extends today to the humanitarian workers of the United Nations, the Red Cross and the many non-governmental organizations. Often in the most difficult of circumstances, it is them that ensure that our humanitarian assistance actually gets to the people who need it on the ground./////Their work is becoming ever more dangerous and time and again the humanitarian aid workers have to pay for their life-saving mission with their own lives. This makes it all the more important to resolutely defend the fundamental principles of humanitarian aid-humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence-and to work to ensure the humanitarian engagement of the helpers and the life-saving assistance they provide is respected and protected worldwide.""//////////World Humanitarian Day was launched by the United Nations in December 2008. All around the world tribute is paid on this day to the work of humanitarian aid organizations and those who lost their lives in action are remembered. On 19 August 2003, the UN Office in Iraq was the target of a bomb attack which claimed 22 lives. The number of humanitarian aid workers who lose their lives in the line of duty is continuing to increase. While 30 lost their lives in 1999, last year it was as many as 102.//////////",0.4
Armed Conflict,    10.06.2010 - Speech,Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle addresses the German Bundestag regarding the UNMIS and UNAMID missions in Sudan/Darfur - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Madam President,ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, /////2010 and 2011 will certainly be defining years for the Sudan. Just a few weeks ago, on 11 April, elections were held in the Sudan for the first time in over 24 years. The people exercised their fundamental democratic right to vote in substantial numbers and civil society displayed courageous engagement./////However, we also know that the election definitely did not meet international standards. The international community rightly criticized the numerous manipulations as being unacceptable. Along with the international community, we call for the Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court. Very serious crimes, such as those committed in Darfur, must be punished; I would like to clearly reiterate that here./////The situation in Darfur continues to be characterized by violence. Time and again, the Doha ceasefire between the government and the rebel groups is broken. The people of Darfur fall victim to the civil war and to criminals who take advantage of the strained security situation./////In Southern Sudan as well, there continue to be bouts of violence between the different ethnic groups. There are countless extralegal militias. There is a threat that these conflicts could be further escalated by extremist forces from northern Sudan. Observers and experts do not exclude the possibility of a renewed outbreak of civil war between north and south./////Given the situation, the Sudan needs greater commitment from the international community-not less. This is also what the interparty proposal on this issue before the German Bundestag rightly calls for. The Federal Government will make this proposal and its constructive recommendations the foundation of its policy. On this basis, we will advocate in international forums and bodies the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as well as a peace treaty for Darfur. In this respect there are five points that are especially important for our engagement that I would like to mention here./////First, the referendum on Southern Sudan's independence must be transparent and peaceful. It is decisive for the future of the Sudan that the outcome be accepted by all parties. The conditions for this must be created now. According to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the referendum must be held by 2011. Providing security for the referendum is one of the key tasks UNMIS has to perform. To ensure that election standards are met, in the European Union we are pushing for a large and comprehensive election observation mission./////Second, Southern Sudan needs stronger state structures. This is essential for the stability of the entire region. During my trip to Africa, my interlocutors in Djibouti and Tanzania stressed the risks an unstable Southern Sudan would present to the entire region. Alongside preparations for the referendum, training security forces in Southern Sudan and disarming extralegal militias is UNMIS's primary task. The southern part of the Sudan will only have a peaceful future if national authorities can guarantee the protection of the civilian population. The German Government can continue to make important contributions to strengthening state structures. There will also be a huge need for advice in the event that the majority of voters vote for Southern Sudan's independence in the referendum. It is necessary to prepare for this possibility even before the referendum because an overwhelming majority of observers believe this is the probable outcome of the vote. We certainly do not want to anticipate the outcome of the vote, but we must be prepared./////Third, we need a successful outcome in the peace talks on Darfur. In the long run, only an agreement among all the conflicting parties will restore calm to the situation. In Berlin this May I assured the United Nations and African Union Chief Mediator Bassole that he had the full support of the German Government. Despite all the setbacks, he is confident that the negotiations will make progress by the end of this year. Of course we hope he is right and that his efforts are successful. Until there is a negotiated solution, and probably even after that, UNAMID in Darfur faces a very difficult task. That is why we will continue to do all we can to support the mission./////Fourth, we cannot reduce our humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts. The people in Darfur depend on the support of the international community. Even if it is not possible to prevent violence everywhere, at least it is possible to alleviate the consequences./////Fifth, and finally, there has to be long-term improvement in the human rights situation across all of the Sudan. We will only see progress here if the security forces in both the north and the south are guided by rule of law criteria. Therefore I repeat that extralegal militias must be disarmed and reintegrated into civilian life. Better education and support within the framework of a demobilization programme is indispensable./////Through the peacekeeping missions, the United Nations is assisting the Sudan in conflict resolution. Germany wants to and will continue to contribute in this regard. The Bundestag mandate for UNMIS is to be extended without any changes to its content. For UNAMID the Federal Government is requesting that the personnel ceiling be adjusted from its current 250 soldiers to 50 soldiers. Within the framework of the mandate, it is no longer necessary for us to arrange flights for the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces) because UNAMID has found reliable solutions for air transport. These are the facts behind the reduction. This adjustment does not mean Germany is reducing its commitment to UNAMID. The mandate is simply being adjusted to future requirements. This serves to maintain the true purpose of the mandate and its clarity, which the German Bundestag rightly values./////Finally, I would like to expressly thank our soldiers, police officers, humanitarian aid and development cooperation workers, as well as our diplomats for all of their hard work. They are making a very important contribution, as I believe we can all imagine, under extremely difficult living and working conditions./////I ask you to support this mandate./////",0.2
Armed Conflict,    22.07.2010 - Press release,Federal Foreign Office increases humanitarian aid for Somalia - Federal Foreign Office ,humanitarian aid,"On his way to Kampala, Uganda, to attend the African Union summit in the city, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle announced a further increase of one million euro in emergency aid for Somalia, bringing total aid this year for the country to 2.7 million euro./////The money will be channelled to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide food, drinking water, medicine and emergency shelter for groups particularly at risk./////Continuing armed clashes have led to a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation, especially in the area of Mogadishu. This year alone over 200,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Most have sought shelter in refugee camps; others have attempted to reach neighbouring countries. This country in the Horn of Africa has been in a state of humanitarian crisis for years. The endemic fighting combined with an unusually severe drought has meant there are now 1.4 million internally displaced persons in the country as well as an estimated 3.8 million in need of humanitarian aid./////The ICRC is among the few humanitarian organizations still able to operate in Somalia. Working in a difficult security environment, it provides basic relief supplies to particularly vulnerable groups such as the injured or internally displaced./////The Federal Foreign Office's humanitarian aid for Somalia now stands at 2.7 million euro for 2010. Over the past three years the German Government has made available over 30 million euro in humanitarian assistance for the country./////For more information on the humanitarian assistance provided by the Federal Foreign Office please consult://///",0.4
Nuclear weapon,    26.03.2010 - Speech,Speech by Guido Westerwelle on presenting the Federal Government's Annual Disarmament Report to the German Bundestag - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,/////in his now famous Prague speech almost exactly a year ago, President Obama sent out a strong message about global disarmament. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons is probably one of the greatest threats to our security. Curbing this danger is a matter of survival, which is why disarmament and arms control are hugely important for the whole of humanity. It is the greatest single challenge to humanity./////The decade has only just begun and we cannot afford to take this issue too lightly. At the beginning of a new decade we stand at a crossroads where we have yet to determine whether it will be a decade of rearmament or disarmament./////The Federal Government is ready to shoulder that responsibility. For this reason I felt it was important to present the Annual Disarmament Report of the Federal Government to this House, the German Bundestag, right at the start of the year./////In the Coalition Agreement we stated that disarmament and arms control were key building blocks for a global security architecture of the future. This has been a guiding principle of the Federal Government's policy since day one and it also sets the compass for the coming years./////In the last century the so-called nuclear balance of terror helped ensure that following the Second World War Europe did not plummet once more into war and destruction. However, some things that were appropriate for the Cold War have now outlived their useful life./////The deterrent effect of nuclear weapons is increasingly being overshadowed by the growing danger of nuclear arms proliferation./////We face the perilous prospect that within ten years the number of nuclear-weapon-states could have doubled, to include countries that are not even on our radar today. We face the prospect that nuclear weapons will be in the possession not only of states but also of terrorists./////Disarmament and arms control are not a concern of the past; they are tasks that require urgent attention in the present and in the future. Disarmament is not simply naive idealism. Pursuing disarmament policy is not ingenuous; indeed the opposite is the case: it would be ingenuous to abandon it./////It is no coincidence that the same foreign policy mediators on both sides of the Atlantic who during their active service as politicians and statesmen advocated with good reason the deterrent approach, today are striving for nuclear disarmament and a nuclear-weapon-free world. Helmut Schmidt, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Richard von Weizsäcker and Egon Bahr are calling for the same approach as Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, George Shultz und William Perry./////Last September the Heads of State and Government of the UN Security Council mapped out the path to a nuclear-weapon-free world. Let me take you back to Resolution 1887 of 24 September 2009. In a historic session led by President Obama, all countries were called upon to commit to this path of disarmament. This also makes it clear that disarmament is not peculiar to Germany but is embedded in the policies of the international community./////The successor agreement to the START I Treaty between the United States of America and Russia is now within reach. We are relying on the very latest talks that are about to begin to produce a result, so that-this is our hope-in a few days it may even be possible to conclude an agreement. A successful conclusion would signal that the two leading nuclear powers, which between them possess more than 90 per cent of all nuclear weapons, are taking their disarmament responsibilities seriously. The agreement could also clear a path for further negotiations, which should include the matter of reducing the number of so-called tactical nuclear weapons./////The Non-Proliferation Treaty sets down three fundamental principles: first the duty of non proliferation, secondly the principle of general and complete disarmament and thirdly, incidentally, also the undisputed right of all countries to civilian use of nuclear energy. The Agreement is based on a reciprocal promise: the commitment to non-proliferation, matched by the nuclear powers' commitment to disarmament. They are two sides of the same coin./////As you know, the Review Conference five years ago failed. The world cannot allow another five years to pass by. We want a successful outcome to the Review Conference in New York in May. We need a renewed commitment from the Treaty States to the rights and obligations of the Treaty; and we want an action plan with concrete steps for bolstering the fundamental principles of the Treaty that I have just spelled out. The Federal Government will work towards this end./////Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, to date Iran has not provided evidence that its nuclear programme is solely in the pursuit of peaceful goals. An Iran in possession of nuclear weapons would not only be the fuse to set off the proverbial powder keg in the region, but would also jeopardize the entire global non-proliferation regime. This is something we in the international community cannot and will not tolerate./////We continue to call upon those states that have achieved the capability to produce nuclear weapons outside of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to renounce the acquisition of nuclear arms and accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The non-proliferation regime is bolstered by every single new accession./////However, we need more than the Non-Proliferation Treaty on the path to a nuclear weapon free world. We can lay the foundations for this at the G8 Foreign Ministers Meeting next Tuesday in Ottawa. With the USA, Russia, France and Great Britain, the G8 brings together four of the five permanent members of the Security Council and simultaneously four of the five original nuclear powers. In Ottawa I intend to work towards a common position among the G8 on disarmament and arms control. If the G8 countries speak with one voice, we can accomplish a great deal in the areas of disarmament and non proliferation./////What we also need is an internationally binding treaty regime to ensure consistent verification of weapons-grade material before it is put to military use. Only in this way can we exclude the possibility of nuclear material falling into the wrong hands. The Federal Chancellor will work towards this goal at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington./////We also need progress on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This Treaty has been signed by 182 countries and ratified by 151. Even though the overwhelming majority of the international community wants it, this Treaty has yet to enter into force. We call on the countries whose ratification we still need for the Treaty to enter into force to delay no more in taking this step, which is so long overdue./////Disarmament and arms control, together with our national defence capabilities and a responsible arms export policy, are indispensable components of the Federal Government's comprehensive security and peace policy. The North Atlantic Alliance is, and will remain, the basis for our security. The core mission of NATO remains the mutual pledge of all Alliance partners to support each other and to ensure collective defence. I make this point explicitly because it is of great concern to many countries, and because they expect assurance and a clear commitment on this issue too. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty will continue to be the backbone of the Alliance in the future./////However, the viability of NATO has a vital effect on the viability of all Alliance partners. That is why it is so important for NATO to find the right responses to the changed global security situation. The Alliance is working on a new strategic concept in the lead up to the NATO Summit in Lisbon in November. NATO must return to being a political locus where we reach agreement with our allies on the whole spectrum of common security policy. Disarmament and arms control also have their place in NATO./////Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, I have initiated a debate with my colleagues from the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Norway in order that the topic ""Disarmament and arms control"", so vital for the future, may once again become an integral part of Alliance policy. We intend to strive for this position in the Alliance at the end of April in Tallinn./////Without a close partnership with Russia a European security architecture is, at best, incomplete. Germany's security is best guaranteed if there is comprehensive security from Vancouver to Vladivostok. It is for this reason that cooperation with Russia is so important. On the issue of missile defence we should spare no effort to find common and cooperative solutions. I am also confident that we can, and shall, discuss the reduction and elimination of tactical nuclear weapons./////This can only happen if we have a more transparent process from the start which strengthens confidence and is directed towards achieving verifiable treaty-based agreements. These weapons are relics of the Cold War: they no longer serve a military purpose, they do not create security and so, in the view of the Federal Government, they have no future./////However, it is also important to make the following point: it goes without saying that any decision on the withdrawal of remaining nuclear warheads from Germany will only be made within the Alliance and in partnership with our allies./////Nuclear disarmament and arms control are the watchword of our time because these weapons have the potential to destroy the whole of humanity. However, it is obvious that in their pursuit we must not neglect the matter of conventional disarmament. We must take care to ensure that nuclear disarmament does not re-open the possibility of conventional wars. For this reason the Federal Government believes that nuclear and conventional disarmament must go hand in hand./////We need an open dialogue between NATO and Russia in order to breathe new life into the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the CFE Treaty, and bring it into line with the needs of our time./////The fact that Germany's voice is heard in international debates on disarmament is also thanks to the credibility German peace policy has earned over the decades. Today we can make the most of this asset we have worked together to achieve in our democracy. I am under no illusion-and neither are you, I know-that the way ahead will be straightforward. Disarmament and treaty-based arms control are hard nuts to crack but we just have to keep working at them with dogged determination. I am pleased that in this the Federal Government can rely on the broad support of this House. My thanks go to all my colleagues from the parliamentary groups-CDU/CSU, Alliance 90/The Greens and of course my own parliamentary group-who support this German security and peace policy strategy in both word and deed. We in the Federal Government see the cross-party motion, that has the overwhelming majority of this House united behind it, as both our duty and obligation. It is right and proper-and it is also important for our citizens to witness and know this-that in these crucial questions we share a bedrock of common values./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.2
Nuclear weapon,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Westerwelle in the Brazilian newspaper__olha de São Paulo"" - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"Germany is viewed as the most probable guarantor for Greek debt in the current crisis and there are rumours that the German Government and German banks are preparing to help Athens in order to save the euro. After the most recent meeting on this issue last month, however, it was said that Federal Chancellor Merkel stopped the aid package from being publicly announced due to concerns over negative opinion polls and, incidentally, that she is against such a package. Now that Greece has made new promises to cut expenditures, is the German Government prepared to take action?/////First, let me start by saying that I am happy to be here in Brazil. Germany and Brazil are not only the largest economies on their respective continents-we also share many common values. To answer your question, we do not make policy on the basis of opinion polls. The truth is that the Greek Government was given clear requirements by the European Commission regarding how and when it needed to return to the course of budget consolidation. I am happy and satisfied that Greece has taken energetic steps to meet these requirements. The markets also seem to have recognized these steps. Now it is important for Greece to also do its homework. We expressly support Greece in this process./////The current crisis concerning Greece has resulted in a number of accusations being made in both countries' media. Greece went so far as to refer to the Second World War, while the German media deemed the Greeks ""traitors"" to the euro. To what extent has this crisis revealed divisions within the euro zone and what does this mean for the future of relations within the bloc?/////Individual opinions should not be overrated and they certainly should not be confused with the position of the respective government. Germany and Greece are close partners in Europe. The euro members are handling the current crisis carefully and are working in close coordination. And we will continue to do so./////Last year Germany lost its title of exports champion to China. Will Berlin simply accept this as reality or are there hopes of regaining the top position in world trade?/////There is absolutely no doubt that Germany will remain a strong exporting nation. In the end, whether we hold the title of ""exports champion"" or not is secondary. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We are convinced that producing innovative, quality products is the best way to guarantee our strength as an exporting nation./////Contrary to expectations, the German economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the German Government's opinion, how long will this stagnation last? Is there a threat of recession without a new stimulus package?/////It is true that the expected economic growth in the last quarter was less than we had hoped for. On the other hand, there is also some good news: exports are picking up again and the German labour market is also continuing to look robust. We support economic development at the national as well as the European level. At the national level, we are stimulating growth through tax relief for families and small businesses./////The first five months of the ""black-yellow"" (Christian Democrat/Free Democrat) coalition have been characterized by quarrelling within and between the parties, public accusations and a sharp downturn for the FDP in public opinion polls. To what extent do these tensions present a risk to the coalition's ability to govern the country?/////Opinion polls change as often as the weather. We have to do what is right. Germany has a stable new government that has defined a clear path./////One of the key points of conflict within the Federal Government is the future of the German welfare state. In this discussion, which is of central importance to the CDU, you made a reference to the period of decadence in the late Roman empire. How can these fundamentally different positions be reconciled without alienating the FDP and CDU from their respective voter bases?/////The future of the welfare state is an issue that is very important to me. Over 60% of the federal budget goes to social purposes and interest payments. This money has to be earned. The public debate we are having in Germany on these issues demonstrates just how important fair compensation is to people./////The Federal Government has delayed making a number of difficult decisions, on tax reform for example, until after the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia in May in order to counter the risk of losing its majority in the Bundesrat (upper house of parliament). Isn't this just postponing decisions that are inevitable anyway? Will it be possible here to find a common denominator in order for the country to move forward?/////You shouldn't construct connections that don't exist. A comprehensive tax or health reform, which I believe is necessary and which we agreed on with our coalition partner, doesn't happen overnight. We have only been in office a few months-a bit more patience is required./////How do you view the recent rapprochement between President Lula and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad? What role could Brazil play in helping to resolve the crisis over Iran's nuclear programme?/////Brazil plays a very important role-and not just because your country is currently a member of the UN Security Council. Our position regarding Iran's nuclear programme is clear: like every other country, Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes. But Iran does not have the right to develop nuclear weapons. That is why we are pursuing a dual-track approach in the international negotiations: we are offering extensive cooperation in the areas of business and technology if Iran is transparent and finally meets the international community's demands. However, due to Iran's adamant refusal to meet these requirements, time is running out. That is why the international community will have to increase pressure on Iran./////On various occasions, you and President Lula have shared similar positions on the need for a treaty on nuclear disarmament. The Brazilian Government criticizes the Non-Proliferation Treaty in particular because it does not specify obligations for the nuclear powers to disarm and has thus created a system of double standards regarding who is allowed to have nuclear weapons and who isn't. That is why Brazil is not planning to approve the revision of the Treaty. What will Germany's position be at the nuclear security conference in Washington this April?/////Here it is important to keep separate issues separate. The content of the global nuclear security summit in Washington in April has little to do with the NPT Review Conference in May. If we want to make the vision of a world without nuclear weapons-as described by President Obama-a reality, we have to ensure that nuclear material cannot fall into the hands of criminals or terrorists. This is what we will be discussing in Washington. We have to adopt specific steps for how we will prevent the unauthorized access to nuclear material. This is what we hope to contribute to in Washington./////At the Copenhagen Climate Conference, the EU put all its eggs in one basket and pursued very ambitious goals. In the end though, it was not possible to win over the developing countries and the EU was excluded from the preparations of the Copenhagen Accord. What happened?/////In Copenhagen, Germany and the EU worked to achieve an ambitious climate policy. Europe played a leading role, and this was recognized. Even after Copenhagen, Europe's commitments to climate protection are still valid and have not been compromised. Unfortunately so far important partners have not yet been able to commit to a similarly ambitious approach./////Concerning the Copenhagen Accord, it is simply not possible to negotiate such a declaration in a group of 194 States parties to the climate convention. What matters is that ultimately the Copenhagen Accord is the product of all participating states./////After the failure in Copenhagen, which forum do you consider to be best-suited to establishing a common global policy for countering climate change? What steps will Germany take if the project of a global approach fails?/////There is no alternative to a climate agreement within the framework of the United Nations. Climate policy used to be regarded as an issue for environmental experts. However, climate protection is a global challenge that also affects foreign policy. That is why foreign policy experts in particular should be closely involved in the negotiation process. We have to broaden the climate dialogue much more than we have in the past. On this issue, Brazil is an especially important partner./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    18.11.2010 - Interview,"Foreign Minister Westerwelle in an interview with Financial Times on the NATO's Strategic Concept, Afghanistan und the situation in the eurozone - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"Source: www.ft.comQuestion: Looking to the Nato summit in Lisbon, are you satisfied with the newstrategic concept, or do you want further amendments?Foreign Minister Westerwelle: Some of Germany's core concerns have been taken into account.The proposals made by the Nato secretary-general are a very good basis. Itis clear that Nato sees itself as a political union of values, and also asa defence alliance it supports the need for disarmament and nuclearnonproliferation. The invitation to Russia to take part in a missiledefence system is of historic importance. The fact that President Medvedevwants to go to Lisbon shows how important that invitation is to Russia. Inmy conversations in Moscow with the Russian government, especially withForeign Minister Lavrov, I got the clear impression that they want to studythe details objectively. That alone is huge progress. I can´t anticipatethe speech of President Medvedev. But look, 20 years after Europe wasreunited after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall, Nato is making an offer toRussia to take part in a defence and security project. There are threepossible responses: to reject it out of hand; to accept it unchecked; or toengage in constructive discussions. That Russia has decided on the thirdway is very welcome.Question: Will the allies themselves agree?Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.Question: Do you think that agreement on a missile defence system will openthe way to further nuclear disarmament?The American government under President Obama has set thecourse with its nuclear posture review. That reduces the strategicimportance of nuclear weapons. As long as there are nuclear weapons in theworld, we in our defence alliance will have to rely on nuclear deterrence.But the way to a nuclear free world depends on confidence-building throughnuclear and other forms of disarmament. After a decade of setbacks fordisarmament, our initiatives seemed to be little more than a trickle. Nowwe´ve got a considerable tide moving. /////In New York we founded a group ofstates from all regions of the world that feel particularly committed tothe goals of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation - Japan, Australiaand Germany are in the lead. And this time the nuclear non-proliferationconference in New York was a success, unlike when it last met five yearsago. The new Start treaty has been agreed. We are counting on its beingratified by the US and Russia. So the debate over nuclear zero is in fullflow round the world. Why are disarmament and nuclear disarmament soimportant? Because they are a commitment that gives us the authority todemand nuclear non-proliferation (from others). Disarmament and nuclearnon-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. If we in the West, if thenuclear powers, disarm, then they will be much more credible in insistingthat other states should not acquire nuclear weapons.Question: But the Americans do not wish to withdraw their medium-rangemissiles from Germany, as you want.I can only respect and applaud the American government forgiving momentum to the disarmament debate. The vision of a nuclear zerowhich the American president talked about in his outstanding speech inPrague is now part of that debate. And that is why I am very happy aboutthe close partnership both with the USA and in particular with my Americancounterpart Hillary Clinton. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is basedon three pillars.1.Anyone can use nuclear energy if they are committed to internationaltransparencyand co-operation.2.The nuclear powers will disarm, so that3.the international community can demand with special authority that no oneelse arms themselves with nuclear weapons.Question: Do you not have a problem with France over your desire to have anarms control committee set up within Nato, while the French want to stressthe importance of nuclear weapons in the new strategic doctrine?/////I would not describe it as a problem, but rather as anecessary discussion in preparation for convergence of different,historically based points of view. France has been a nuclear power fordecades, just like Britain, and naturally has a different attitude when itcomes to the role of nuclear weapons to what we have for example inGermany. We have learned the lessons of our history. But at the G8 summitin 2009, France also recognised the goal of a world without nuclearweapons. So the fct that we need to discuss the question is perfectlynormal. /////We are 28 Nato member states, and naturally they need to bringtheir different positions closer together. Let me tell you straight out:the Nato strategic concept will protect our common security interests, andaddress new challenges, stress our community of values, and - reallyrevolutionary for a defence alliance - also emphasise the role ofdisarmament for global security. Every concept sets a goal and at the sametime amounts to an agreement on common action. That is why it is astrategic concept. The last Nato concept was agreed in 1999. After Lisbonyou should just do one thing: look at the old concept of 1999 beside thenew concept. I am sure that the role of disarmament will clearly be givenmore weight.Question: Is there not a danger that this new concept will push Nato in thedirection of become a global policeman. Am I justified in fearing that?We are sticking to the core commitment of Nato in Article V.That means we will defend ourselves in the case of any armed attack. We arenot going to water that down. But it is equally clear that everything Natodoes in the future will be in accordance with international law. Ourbehaviour is in accordance with international law. /////There are certainly newthreats that have arisen that we did not foresee in previous years, such asterrorist threats, or the danger of the spread of weapons of massdestruction. That should not just be considered from the point of view ofstates arming themselves and therefore making whole regions unstable. Ontop of that, the more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the greateris the danger of terrorist groups or other criminal organisations gettingtheir hands on nuclear weapons potential. And 20 people with one atom bombis an army.Question: But is it the job of Nato to find these people and destroy them?We have been fighting together against terrorism for a longtime, including on the instructions of the United Nations. We and many ofthe other Nato member states are in Afghanistan with a UN mandate. That wasthe difference with the war in Iraq. We are in Afghanistan on the basis ofa Un decision, clearly based on international law.Question: Is Gaza the sort of place you can see Nato operating in apeacekeeping capacity?/////I think that regional conflict resolution must stem from theparties to the conflict, and above all must be supported by the UN. The UNis an organisation, especially the Security Council, that gets involvedaround the world in the solution of regional conflicts and the promotion ofregional stability. In my view, the UN role cannot be replaced by any othersort of defence alliance.Question: But when is a terrorist attack part of a regional conflict, and whenis it an attack on Nato itself?You can´t say that abstractly or theoretically. One must judgeon a caseby- case basis. What we are working on is conflict prevention,above all else.Question: That is an integral part of it. The new strategic concept is part ofthe worldwide reaction to September 11_and a great deal more. We have so many new challenges. Thedanger of weapons of mass destruction, the danger of computer attacks,so-called asymmetric threats. And moreover, we haven´t just got Article V,we also have Article IV, for example regarding consultation in thealliance.Question: You have talked of computer wars, and I must confess that I amastonished that this strategic concept does not attempt to change Article Vto allow for mutual defence against computer attacks.The debates will only take place when we get to Lisbon. Wemight as well give up the summit if I tell you about the whole concept now!Question: But how are we going to deal with computer wars, how can we organiseourselves against them? As you said, that is one of the big new dangers. Wealready saw that in Estonia and in Georgia, and interestingly most recentlyin Iran. What should the Nato summit do to defend us all against thisdanger?Well that is precisely the sort of question which requiresinternational co-operation, even beyond Nato. I am no technical expert, andalso no computer specialist who can give you a practical answer. We havealso had a thorough discussion of this in our federal government, what weshould do against such computer attacks. In American or British English youseem to speak very easily of war. I would avoid that. You speak of war_Question: Like cyber war_Precisely, and I speak rather of computer attacks, because theword war is more easily and frequently used in English. You have a waragainst climate change, don´t you?Question: Yes.In English one talks rather easily about a war against this orthat. In Germany we are very cautious about using the word war. That is whywe don´t speak of a computer war, but of computer attacks.Question: Or of armed conflicts?Certainly not! We are speaking of attacks. The precisetranslation simply has another resonance, the meaning is more loaded. It´sno wonder. I am speaking of computer attacks, and we will naturally alsodiscuss these questions. That is why I pointed out that we don´t just haveArticle V. There are also further questions of cooperation andconsultation, that is all part of it.Question: But in Estonia the whole financial and government system came undercomputer attacks. And Estonia was already a Nato member, but Nato could notdo anything about it.Perhaps so, because we must first become more technicallycompetent to defend with such new challenges. But that is not the job ofheads of state and government, or for foreign ministers, or even defenceministers. We have to agree on a strategy. We determine that there is achallenge that concerns our security, and then naturally we must talk aboutthe details of how we find an appropriate answer, which should beproportional, efficient and focussed.Question: If it is clear that such attacks come from Russia, how is itpossible to have a closer cooperation with the Russians?I know of suspicions, but no proof.Question: Can I ask you about Afghanistan? It is clear that the Germanpopulation is not enthusiastic about this ""armed conflict"". How long canyou ensure the population still supports your involvement? How long can youstay in the country?In Lisbon we will begin the process of handing overresponsibility, by making it clear that next year we will hand overresponsibility for security to Afghanistan and Afghan authorities in thefirst provinces. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to have handedover responsibility for security entirely to the Afghan government during2014. /////So we are opening up a perspective of withdrawal. If we begin to handover responsibility for security in the coming months, that should not beconfused with beginning a troop withdrawal, but as a precondition formaking our withdrawal possible one day in the future.Question: The Americans say that we Europeans do not do enough to convince ourvoters that this war is worthwhile. Is the future of Nato itself notendangered by the war in Afghanistan?I see a lot of shadows and many setbacks - especially with thesecurity situation. But I also see some light and many good developments.Take the elections, which are part of good governance: Naturally theelections are rightly criticised because of attempts at manipulation, butthe good thing is what is happening from Afghanistan itself. It isimportant progress that the first mandates that were awarded because ofmanipulation at the count were immediately cancelled. These were the firstelections in Afghanistan that took place under Afghan supervision. Therewas not only higher voter participation, but also a lot of complaints fromthe population itself, from Afghans themselves, and the Afghan authoritiesdrew their conclusions. They cancelled elections that were won throughmanipulation, and that is remarkable. /////I find it healthy that Germans have afundamentally sceptical attitude towards foreign (military) deployments.That is because of the dreadful first half of the last century. At the sametime, Germans live up to their international responsibility in an exemplaryfashion, considering for example that they are the third largest supplierof international troops. /////Both parties in the government have stated thatthey support the intervention in Afghanistan, and they have a majority forthat view. The same people who are inwardly sceptical about foreignmilitary interventions - which I find a justified view - have alsorecognised the necessity and given those parties a big majority insupporting the Afghan intervention. Both poles shape our foreign policy:the culture of military restraint, and at the same time, the recognition ofour international responsibility. Germany is an excellent model in that.Question: Has Germany changed in the past 20 years, since unification? Iremember Helmut Kohl saying he could not conceive of a German soldierserving in the Balkans.Yes. Germany has changed since reunification. This process hasbeen strenuously thought through both in society and in the democraticprocess. If you think of our engagement in the western Balkans, that´s agood example of how successful the intervention of our soldiers can by instabilising the situation, for we were able to reduce our troop numbers inKFOR massively, from 8,500 to just 2,500 today. /////In the meantime, President Tadic has worked through a policy changetowards Kosovo. In Vukovar, in Croatia, he made a remarkable speechapologising for the massacre committed by Serbian troops. /////So things are moving in the right direction there. Iwould also mention the fight against pircy. The impression is given thereas if it was just a question of economic interests. If it´s a question ofprotecting our shipping ands therefore ensuring that aid can get to Africa.That was the starting point of the exercise, and it is succeeding.Question: But in terms of power projection internationally, do you thinkGermans really believe in it? Or will there be a great battle in societyover every future military intervention, wherever it may be?I have just said I am happy that we have a healthy scepticismtowards military interventions of the Bundeswehr. There is nothing wrongwith that. Some foreign politicians may see it as a lack of firmness, butonly if they have not really studied the darkest chapter in our history.Unlike most of our alliance partners, we have a parliamentary army. Thatmeans that every foreign intervention must be approved by our parliament -with a proposal from the government, but decided by the parliament. All ourfriends in the world should be happy that Germany has drawn its lessonsfrom history, and not just in the federal constitution, with its principleof a parliamentary army rather than a government army, but also it is avital element in society, given the readiness both to take internationalresponsibility, and to have a healthy scepticism and a culture of militaryrestraint that lies deep in the hearts of our people. I am proud of boththings.Question: In Brussels many people are saying that Germany has also changed itsattitude towards Europe since reunification - that Germany is more insistent on itsnational interests, and has become very tough in the whole saga of theeurozone crisis. What would you say about that?/////In the preamble of the constitution of the German FederalRepublic stand the two core principles of its foreign policy: to servepeace in the world in a united Europe. Because of that, Germany won a twothirds majority outright in the UN, against two very respectablecandidates, in the first vote (for a seat on the Security Council), becausewe have made multilateralism and European integration our politicalprinciples. /////In my first year as foreign minister I visited all the Europeanmember states, and not just big France and Britain, or Poland, Italy andSpain, but also others like Luxembourg, the three Baltic states and Malta.We regard our European policy as a partnership on the same level for allmember states, whether they are bigger or smaller, and whether they areeconomically more successful or unfortunately for a while rather lesssuccessful.Question: But what about this agreement in Deauville between France andGermany: all the rest had to fall in with it. Don´t you think you stressyour relationship with France too much in an enlarged EU?At the very beginning of my time in office, I revived theso called Weimar triangle. That is the close partnership between France,Poland and Germany. This Weimar triangle has become an important motor inthe EU, alongside the close partnership between France and Germany that hasgrown up over decades.Question: But the eurozone is different?As far as the stability culture is concerned we have manyallies precisely amongst those who joined the EU in the last years.Question: But the Poles weren´t happy about the Deauville deal with France.What counts is what was finally agreed.Question: Are you happy with that?/////I am happy that the Chancellor was able to successfullynegotiate what we agreed in the cabinet after Deauville would be thenegotiating mandate. Three points are most important. First, thatviolations of responsible budget planning do not remain unpunished, andpolitical opportunism must as far as possible not interfere with impositionof sanctions. /////I am one of those who, as a member of the opposition in theBundestag, criticised the relaxation of the stability pact-at Germany´sinstigation - in 2004/5 as a historic mistake. Unfortunately the partiesthat were in government then, and are now in opposition, have refused tosupport the solution to the problems caused by their own mistaken decision.Second, the creation of a crisis mechanism, which will not be a (EU)community instrument, because that would mean creating a form of legalliability that would not be acceptable in our German legal system. /////Third, we do not want to relieve private creditors of their responsibility.Those who bet against countries, and loses those bets, and yet can gohome with their profits untouched, they won´t be let off. That must change.Question: Do you agree with the Chancellor that if the Euro fails, then Europewill fail?/////Neither the euro, nor Europe, will fail. That is why theChancellor and I as foreign minister are working for its success. I am aEuropean patriot.Question: What does that mean?It means that I am one of the first politicians in the countrywho is happy to say publicly that I am proud of my country - and that waslong before the World Cup in 2006. I see Germany as embedded in a Europe ofvalues and co-operation. For me Europe is much more than a common currency,and far more than a system to ensure our welfare at a time ofglobalisation, much more than an internal market and the freedom to travel./////For me, Europe is a community of values. It is a political union thatserves both peace and freedom. Therefore the euro is a currency of freedom,and not just a means of exchange. The European model of co-operation isdemanding, arduous, nerve-wracking even, and the negotiations often go onall night. And the European model of co-operation also costs money,although a lot less than it would cost to eliminate the sort of conflictsthat regularly occurred in past centuries. The model of co-operation hastaken over from the model of confrontation. And that is an unbelievablegood fortune for our generation. You are sitting here in a building aroundwhich everything was bombed to bits in the war. You are sitting in a placethat was the source of oppression in a socialist dictatorship. In one hourby car you can be in Poland, and there are no more border conflicts. /////For the first time since Germany existed, it is surrounded by friendly stateswho have organised themselves under a single European roof. Anyone who doesnot love Europe can´t be helped. They´re just thoughtless. If you takeEurope for granted, then you will begin to lose it, and that isextraordinarily dangerous. I see disturbing tendencies towardsrenationalisation, regrettably both in Europe and in many countries of theworld. But it is our task to oppose this tendency wherever it may be found.Question: But I read some awful articles in Bild Zeitung about Greece earlierthis year. That worried me a bit.I ask you: there are always debates and bad ideas, in bar-roomconversations and in the media, but we are talking now about responsiblepolicy. You must have a clear compass, and mine has one clear co-ordinate,and that is Europe.Question: One last question: were you not rather disappointed that PresidentObama said in Delhi that he supported India´s desire to become a permanentmember of the UN Security Council? He has never said it about Germany.President Obama was speaking to the Indian and not the Germanparliament. If he had not supported India for the Security Council in hisspeech, it would have been a strange omission. I expect that he will make asimilarly friendly remark in Japan, where he is going at the end of theweek.Question: And then you´ll invite him to the Bundestag?When he next has time to visit Germany I will be delighted tohear the friendly words that President Obama, a man I greatly admire, willfind for both Brazil and Germany./////(The questions were posed by Quentin Peel and Gerritt Wiesmann)//////////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    11.11.2010 - Speech,"Foreign Minister Westerwelle's statement to the German Bundestag on NATO's Strategic Concept, 11 November 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ translation of advanced text __//////////Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured colleagues,/////For decades now, NATO has guaranteed our common security. Even those of you who like to demonstrate against NATO-as is your good right-must not forget that this freedom to demonstrate is also the result of our successful security policy and of NATO's existence./////Our debate next week on the Strategic Concept will set NATO's course for the years to come. Before going any further I would like to thank NATO's Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. I would also like to express my special thanks to Madeleine Albright and her group of experts for the important preparatory work they have done. Our impression is-subject of course to next week's decisions in Lisbon-that the submitted draft provides an excellent basis for further deliberations. It takes our security interests into account. But it also makes it clear that we are a community of shared values. NATO is not first and foremost a military alliance, but a transatlantic community of values./////I would like to comment on a few specific points, without however wishing to prejudice the outcome of the deliberations. Today's debate is a preliminary debate that will provide guidance for those of us taking part in the negotiations next week-to ensure that the right course is taken. We, the Federal Government, are pursuing a number of objectives with regard to the Strategic Concept, for which we will seek support during the negotiations./////One key objective is for NATO to commit itself to disarmament and arms control. Earlier this year, at the discussions in April, we managed to win a considerable number of allies for this goal. We all know that implementing President Obama's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons is of its nature a very long-term goal, but it is a very rational goal. We want to support all steps in this direction. A reduced role for nuclear weapons is thus rightly part of the strategy that we, the Federal Government, want to support./////The debate next week in Lisbon should not be the final word on the issue. It must of course be continued. The debate on disarmament and arms control has not been concluded, but will continue in a follow-up process designed to bring us closer to our goal of a world without nuclear weapons. Progress has undeniably been made. This is shown for example by the USA's Nuclear Posture Review and in particular by this year's Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that took place in New York. This Conference did not end in failure, as the last one five years ago did. Rather, joint conclusions were agreed./////It is right that NATO considers itself a security alliance and a political union of shared values and has therefore committed itself to disarmament. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. They belong together. Our times have brought new challenges and new threats. The more states that are in a position to acquire nuclear weapons, the greater the danger that terrorists groups may have access to them. Precisely that is what we must prevent, in the interest of the citizens of our countries, by taking far-sighted and wise action./////Of course it is necessary to include tactical nuclear weapons in this discussion. We remain committed to their withdrawal. However, we hope that this issue will first and foremost provide impetus for a much broader effort. The disarmament debate is now gathering momentum. I am thinking for example of the New Start Treaty. We very much hope that this Treaty will be ratified by the US, notwithstanding the changes wrought by the congressional elections, so that it can come into effect./////There is another remarkable, and in my opinion historic change-the missile defence programme, advocated and launched by President Bush, has taken an entirely new direction. While the missile defence project was initially conceived by the US as something to be implemented with one or two allies in Europe, it has now become a project pursued by the entire Alliance./////What is particularly important is that Russia has been invited to participate. We do not want there to be differing zones of security in Europe. We do not want divides in Europe when it comes to security, we want common ground. The fact that President Medvedev has said he will come to the Lisbon Summit is a significant gesture. We want to improve our security with Russia, not against Russia. That is NATO's clear message./////I think we all have to acknowledge that we have come a tremendous way in this respect. If you cast your mind back to what was under discussion 20 or 30 years ago, and compare it to now, to Russia being invited by NATO to participate in discussions on missile defence and security, and Russia's response-it doesn't refuse but says it will observe, assess and consider its options-then we have to realize this is an historic development that we shouldn't just wave through. We should rejoice. This is the peace dividend, the dividend of years and decades of hard work by politicians in many countries, of all political colours./////We have discussed this issue in the NATO-Russia Council, for example, which has been reinvigorated. These are good and sensible steps./////To conclude, I would like to underscore that we still consider NATO to be at core a defensive alliance. In other words, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is not open to debate-and that's something I'd like to say in particular to the eastern European member states. We are aware of the new challenges, such as cyber-attacks. But we also know that the mechanisms specified in Article 5 are not the only ones. The consultation mechanisms of Article 4 are also there to be used. That, too, must be taken into consideration. Strict adherence to international law thus remains our compass./////We are guided by two principles here. We want to shoulder international responsibilities. But we also want to continue our culture of military restraint. That is a clear line for the Federal Government as a whole. All other claims are absurd. We will live up to our international responsibilities, but we will adhere to a culture of military restraint./////The German Bundestag will have its eye on all Bundeswehr deployments. On behalf of the Federal Government I can assure you once again of our guiding principle, our compass: the Bundeswehr is not our governmental army, nor is it the army of any party or political majority. The Bundeswehr is a parliamentary army that can only act with parliament's consent. That, too, is a guiding principle in our negotiations within the Alliance./////Thank you very much for your attention./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    29.03.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Federal Minister Westerwelle at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 29 March 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __//////////Lieber Herr Breitschwerdt,/////Ihnen und den Mitgliedern der deutsch-kanadischen Handelskammer ganz herzlichen Dank fr die Einladung zu diesem Festakt.//////////Minister Pupatello, Minister Van Loan,/////President Naylor,/////It is a real honour and pleasure to be here with you. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today at this eminent University, in this dynamic city, in this huge province and beautiful country./////Canada is known worldwide as a tolerant and open-minded country. As host of the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games Canada was the focus for all sports fans around the world. Let me thank Canada for such wonderful Games. Once more Canada has lived up to its high reputation and presented itself as a wonderful host. And I am happy to congratulate Canada on its first position in the medal table. By the way, Germany came in second./////Ladies and Gentlemen,/////In purely geographical terms Canada and Germany are far apart. But when it comes to our values and our interests Canada and Germany are very close. Our two countries share the same fundamental values. These include democracy and the rule of law, the need for international cooperation and the primacy of international law. We share a similar understanding of the value of individual freedom. All of these values bind us together./////To defend these common values Canadian Forces were based in Germany for four decades. From 1954 to 1994 Canadian men and women helped us to confront Communism along the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. More than 400.000 Canadians lived in Germany to protect our shared free and democratic ideals. We thank you for your staunch support and your strong friendship./////And it was here in Canada, in Ottawa, at the Open Skies Conference in 1990, that the process of negotiating the Two plus Four Agreement was started. This year we celebrate with gratitude the 20th anniversary of German Unification./////That you had an event here to commemorate the beginning of the Two plus Four process is something I really appreciate./////Let me assure you: The German people will not forget the part Canada played in bringing down the Berlin Wall and in the unification of our country. Some people speak of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, but the Wall did not fall, people brought it down. We will always be very grateful to Canada./////German foreign policy is value-based and interest-led. That is not a contradiction but the two sides of the same coin. The German-Canadian relationship reflects this combination in a unique manner. Our relationship is not only based on shared values, but also on shared interests./////Both our countries are major economic powers, both are heavily dependent on exports. More than many other countries Germany and Canada have to be concerned about the lurking dangers of protectionism. All countries profit from free trade. But more than elsewhere our prosperity is a result of free access to foreign markets./////Both of us face competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Our two countries cannot-and don't want to-compete on salaries or social and environmental standards with those countries. The cheaper the products from those countries, the better and more advanced our products have to be. More than many other countries Canada and Germany have to stay at the forefront of research and development to maintain prosperity./////This year we celebrate one hundred years of Canadian-German trade relations./////Today our bilateral annual trade volume adds up to more than 10 billion Euros. The EU is Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. Canadian-German trade relations are a success story. But there is still potential for further growth./////As Minister for Foreign Affairs I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal. Soon after taking office I saw to it that strategies were developed with the aim of enhancing Germany's external economic policy. We want to open up external economic promotion to other sectors and make it more attractive to small and medium__ized companies in particular. These form the backbone of the German economy. Let me assure you: I will pursue external economic promotion not with timidity but with vigor. In other words, I will do it the Canadian way. It is no accident that your foreign ministry is called ""Department for Foreign Affairs and International Trade""./////In a globalized world it is not enough for countries like Canada and Germany just to expand their trade volume. We have to deepen our trade relations./////That is why in 2007, when Germany held the Presidency of the European Union, we lobbied hard to get the EU to work with Canada on a ""Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"". Both sides have been doing their homework. Formal discussions have begun and are going well. They take us into new territory for our bilateral relations. To meet the goals we have set, we have to look at investment rules; at provincial as well as federal government procurement; at regulations; at intellectual property rights; at local competition policies; at labour and environment issues. We may not be able to agree on everything but a substantial agreement will not only be a major boost to Canadian-European trade, but also to the German and Canadian position on the global market./////Both our countries will only be able to keep their positions at the forefront of prosperous states if we make sure that we maintain our position at the high end of the value chain./////To do that, we have to invest heavily in education, in innovation, in science and in research and in development. The answer is to use our advantages, to bring out the very best that we can offer to the world. And, more and more, that is something we do in partnership with other countries./////Just one example: Research in Motion and their latest Blackberry: They came up with a keyboard that is very small and still easy to use because every single letter is cleverly and differently shaped. That was invented at RIM's new facility in Bochum, Germany./////And there are many other similar examples./////By combining the best of research and science in many countries we stay competitive in a globalized world. In that respect, Germany, the EU and Canada have a lot to offer each other./////Education is the number one priority in both our countries. The new German government will invest an extra 12 billion Euro in education, research and development. But improving educational institutions is not only a question of money. It is also a question of structures./////Business schools have long talked about ""best practices"". Learning from each other about what works and what does not./////One very good example of ""best practices"" is the award given in 2008 by the Bertelsmann Foundation, one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany, to the Toronto District School Board for its work in providing fair and equal opportunities for all children. At the awards ceremony, the Foundation said: ""The school system in Toronto shows us what actions we have to take, considering the challenges we are facing from globalization, migration and demographic change"". Using the experience of Toronto, the Foundation has launched its own programme in Germany called ""Integration Through Education""./////I think this is the way forward. As the challenges we face grow more complex, we all profit from looking for solutions also beyond our borders./////The global economic and financial crisis has not led to a slowing down or halt in the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely because of a lack of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must prevent global problems from turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops on the basis of a set of rules and values. Let me underline this: Our shared goal must be to give globalization a set of rules and values so that peace, security and prosperity are safeguarded in the long term./////Here we see Canada as a natural partner, because we share the same fundamental values and interests./////As I am travelling to the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today, let me point out just two topics Canada and Germany are dealing with side by side right now at the global level://///Both Germany and Canada have a strong interest in nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. As countries that do not possess nuclear weapons we want to contribute to strengthening the international regime against the proliferation of nuclear weapons while making nuclear technology available for peaceful uses. I am therefore pleased that the Canadian G8 Presidency has made non-proliferation a priority issue at our meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today and tomorrow./////A related and very important issue at the G8 meeting will be the nuclear dispute with Iran. We are very concerned about Iran's unwillingness and inability to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. I would like to underline that we are not against Iran using nuclear power for the peaceful production of energy. We have offered a generous package of assistance in exchange for assurances. But the Iranian leadership should understand that we cannot and will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. It would constitute a major threat to regional stability but it would also undermine the global non-proliferation regime. Our hand to Iran remains outstretched. But in the absence of a response and real progress the international community has to prepare stronger sanctions against Iran. We will discuss the situation and the way forward at our meeting tomorrow./////Canada and Germany are long term partners, on the bilateral and the global level./////We may be on two different continents but on the major challenges of our time we stand as one./////Over the last century our relations have been deepened, improved and strengthened. I am very optimistic that we will continue in that direction in the future. Not only because our governments agree upon many topics, but because of the deep friendship between our peoples./////Thank you very much./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    28.04.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Minister of State Werner Hoyer at the opening of a conference on ""European Security Dialogue and Arms Control"" - Federal Foreign Office ",dialogue,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////It is my firm belief that European security dialogue, arms control and military confidence-building are inextricably linked. So I'm very glad this whole complex is the focus of this year's conference, once again organized in cooperation with the Marshall Center. Only such a dialogue can create the necessary broad basis for long-term cooperative security in Europe./////This year's conference is taking place at a very interesting juncture. Following the successful conclusion of the New START Treaty early this month, the issue of conventional arms control and disarmament in Europe is once more in the spotlight. The prospects for a serious, in depth debate on the subject are now brighter than they've been for a long time. If our conference can help move this debate forward, it will have accomplished its objective./////Here in this city twenty years ago the Wall was torn down that had divided Europe for decades. Ever since our continent has been growing together on a basis of close partnership. In the light of Europe's centuries of shared history, this is a new and unique situation, a real cause for rejoicing./////The Euro-Atlantic area today is more secure-in classic, defence policy terms-than it ever was in the past. Former adversaries have become allies, partners and friends. This is a remarkable success./////In terms of political stability and economic prosperity, too, Europe has benefited and recorded impressive gains. The Open-Door policy pursued by NATO and the EU has played a crucial rule in stabilizing our new partner countries and member states. The countries of the Western Balkans, in the nineties the scene of horrific fighting and war crimes, are progressively embarking on reforms that will bring them closer to the European Union. Croatia and Albania are already members of NATO./////These successes, however, are only one aspect of a very diverse picture. For clearly pan European security is still unfinished business even two decades after the fall of the Wall. In recent years this has become increasingly obvious./////The most recent wake up call was in 2008, when the fighting in and around Georgia drove home just how explosive allegedly ""frozen"" conflicts can become. None of the existing organizations or instruments at our disposal could prevent the escalation of the conflict and the outbreak of hostilities./////We need to recognize, too, that the potential for cooperation between the various organizations operating in the Euro-Atlantic area has yet to be fully tapped. We've failed to consistently exploit synergies between relevant instruments, on occasions we haven't exploited them at all in fact. Here I'm thinking first and foremost of the truly gridlocked relationship between NATO and the EU./////Another problem is that in many respects our perceptions of security and our reading of history twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall greatly diverge. We see this in the OSCE on many of the issues on its agenda and we see it most noticeably in relations between Russia and NATO./////So it's time for a new approach. What's needed now is to bring the European security project to a successful conclusion. That is a real challenge, for we have differing views about the correct diagnosis and most especially about what needs changing. This is not only a challenge, however, but also an opportunity, since the odds that we will succeed are better today than they were just a few years ago./////One important aspect of the discussion relates to Russia's proposals for a new European security treaty. There's no doubt the Russian initiative has played a key role in triggering the current intense debate on the future of European security. What began with the OSCE's Corfu Process is now a hot topic in the NATO-Russia Council as well as among think tanks and political commentators across the Euro-Atlantic area./////One of the initiative's core aims is to give the principle of indivisible security concrete substance. What President Medvedev is suggesting here is that this established OSCE principle should be transposed into law. That is a perfectly reasonable approach./////It does, however, raise a number of issues which are hard to define and clarify in legal terms. How, for example, does the concept of indivisible security fit with the freedom of countries to choose what alliances they belong to, something to which we are all committed? How do we reconcile indivisible security across the entire European region with the security guarantees provided by existing alliances? I fear it would be a difficult business to resolve such issues in a legal document./////As I see it, it would be better to concentrate our efforts on translating the principle of indivisible security into quite tangible, practical reality. Indivisible security means in my view finding ways to enable conflicts of interest to be converted into constellations that will yield returns for all parties./////A joint missile defence system, for example, would be an impressive concrete demonstration of indivisible security in the Euro-Atlantic area. Just recently NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen outlined for us what such a missile defence system under a shared roof could mean: shared benefits and costs, shared intelligence and collaboration on developing relevant technologies. At present that may all sound utopian. But with the recent shift in US policy, there is now a realistic prospect we can indeed start thinking and travelling in this direction. Let's grasp this opportunity!/////And let's grasp the opportunity to move forward in other areas, too://///by embracing an ambitious disarmament agenda in the area of sub-strategic and conventional weapons systems;/////by ensuring greater transparency in armament projects and security-relevant export transactions;/////by actively pushing ahead with the joint assessment of security threats now under way in the NATO-Russia Council./////The ongoing dialogue within the Corfu Process offers an opportunity to strengthen the OSCE's existing dispute settlement mechanisms. The Medvedev proposals, too, contain ideas for a conflict prevention mechanism. There is a realistic prospect, I believe, that the still widely divergent views in this area can at least be brought more into alignment./////The German Government is very conscious that Russia has not always been and is not now an easy partner. In their dealings with Russia or possible future members, EU and NATO countries are not prepared in any way to compromise their values, for that would be to sacrifice their own credibility. Given these many differences, building a security partnership that is viable over the long term is a formidable task./////On one of the most complex issues on the conference's agenda, the importance of military alliances for a united and free Europe, Poland's Deputy Defence Minister Stanislaw Komorowski had planned to give a speech today. He was killed in the appalling plane crash in Smolensk along with the Polish President, the nation's top military and a large number of fellow parliamentarians. This tragedy and the way our Polish friends and neighbours mourned their loss left many Germans deeply moved. We are most grateful that, in this most difficult time for Poland, Adam Kobieracki, the man in charge of security policy at the Foreign Ministry, has agreed to speak here in his place. Mr Kobieracki was NATO's first Assistant Secretary General from a new member state and will certainly have much of interest to tell us about the huge importance joining NATO had for the young democracies in Eastern and Central Europe and how this helped them consolidate their new status./////In our view, too, NATO's Open Door policy remains a valuable instrument; no country wishing NATO membership should in principle be denied that option. What is equally important, however, is that NATO membership should enhance stability in Europe as a whole. NATO's Open Door policy must not be used as a political tool-as was sometimes the case in the past-to sideline certain countries. By the same token, it must accept both now and in the future that countries may prefer the option of neutrality./////Even today the Alliance's security and attractiveness is based on its mutual defence guarantee and collective defence efforts. But it is also based on close cooperation with partners that are not members of the Alliance. This has been the case ever since the Harmel Report and is even more the case today, for many of the new risks and threats we face emanate not from states but from non-state actors or arise in areas where state authority is weak or ineffectual. So clearly the most effective way to tackle new challenges is through a network of global partnerships./////This Alliance stands ""for"" something-for cooperation, stability, security. It is not ""against"" anything or anyone-let alone Russia, let me make that quite clear. That would most definitely not be in NATO's interest, for we all have to recognize that many problems-in the southern Caucasus, too, by the way-cannot be resolved without Russia and certainly not by challenging Russia. That means logically there is simply no alternative to NATO-Russia cooperation, even if, understandably, for reasons of history this may not be to everyone's taste./////There's no way either that Russia can realize its ideas of Euro-Atlantic security by challenging tried and tested institutions which have made a valuable contribution to European integration. So the right course for both sides is to press actively and consistently for greater cooperation-and of course there's unlimited scope for intensifying cooperation./////Building a cooperative security architecture with Russia means focusing on two key aspects: firstly, the future of regional cooperative security arrangements and, secondly, arms control in Europe./////Here we need to fix our sights particularly on the Black Sea region, including the southern Caucasus. Greatly enhanced stability, security and cross-border cooperation: that must be our aim for the region. That means we must continue to strengthen not only bilateral but also multilateral cooperation with the region over a broad front. We believe the prime tools for this are the European Neighbourhood Policy programmes, in other words, the Black Sea Synergy Initiative and the Eastern Partnership./////The Black Sea Synergy Initiative was launched during Germany's EU Council presidency in 2007 with the aim of promoting practical cooperation in sectors of transnational, regional importance. The crucial thing is to bring on board all interested countries in the wider Black Sea region, including Turkey and Russia. After a halting start what we're seeing now is like a spring awakening from winter sleep. The first environmental sector partnership was established in March 2010, others in the transport and energy sectors are due to follow./////A year after its launch in Prague in May 2009 the Eastern Partnership has already a host of tangible successes to its credit. Despite their sometimes marked differences of opinion, partners are now clearly cooperating. The negotiations the EU is conducting with a number of countries on association agreements are also making good progress. In January the EU opened negotiations with Moldova on an association agreement; with Ukraine these negotiations are already well advanced. In May the EU plans to approve the relevant mandates to open negotiations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia./////As I mentioned early on, the essential, key requirement for any kind of cooperation among the countries of Europe is a degree of mutual trust. We in Germany are convinced the best way to build such trust is a comprehensive arms control regime. In recent years far too much time has been lost here, which we now have to make good./////Right now it remains unclear whether a European conventional arms control regime has any future. Here we should remind ourselves that whatever advances, whatever successes there have been since the end of the Cold War, a Europe free of threat perceptions and regional conflicts is still a long way off. It's true that new threats such as international terrorism, nuclear proliferation or Internet-based cyber attacks now loom larger in our security risk assessments, but what I might call ""old-fashioned"" military threats continue to be seen in Europe as a danger to be reckoned with. That's why conventional arms control must be part and parcel of a comprehensive cooperative security architecture in Europe-it's a sine qua non./////Combined with confidence- and security-building measures, a conventional arms control regime provides predictability and transparency on a broad, solid footing. Another reason we need such a regime is to safeguard Europe's security for the longest foreseeable period with the minimum possible military resources. It's not least budgetary constraints that compel us to become more creative here. There is now, both economically and politically, a window of opportunity for an arms control dividend, so to speak-and it's an opportunity we must not miss./////Given the current pressure on budgets, I'm absolutely sure no country in Europe today can afford to fund massive conventional capabilities for national defence. That makes the case for a workable conventional arms control regime that contributes to structural crisis prevention even more compelling. For if the risk of military conflict is to be effectively reduced, we need a realistic and reliable assessment of military assets and capabilities-as well as the mutual trust generated by cooperating together./////But the only way conventional arms control can truly live up to present and future expectations is by taking the present security policy environment in Europe into account and evolving continually in the light of new developments. The existing arms control regime at any rate does not live up to these expectations./////Overcoming the deadlock in such a core area of European security will be no mean task. We must seize the moment now and put every effort into finding ways to resolve the current crisis./////As I said at the beginning, there's now a realistic prospect it can be done. The US Administration's recent appointment of a Special Envoy for Conventional Armed Forces in Europe confirms the renewed American interest in conventional arms control. Russia, too, has announced that it's keen to see a viable conventional arms control regime./////Of course we're well aware that conventional and nuclear disarmament are interconnected. But I totally disagree with the view that conventional disarmament would mean a greater risk of nuclear weapons being actually used. We must also refute the argument that nuclear disarmament would mean a greater risk of conventional war./////In the nuclear sphere threats emanating from outside the Euro-Atlantic area pose by far the greater danger. North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, the proliferation risks associated with these technologies and Iran's nuclear ambitions not only pose a direct threat to all of us and the international order as a whole but also increase the likelihood of a dangerous arms build up in various parts of the world. The growing number of countries today with capabilities in proliferation-relevant fuel cycle technologies goes hand in hand with increasing risks of abuse. Nuclear terrorism is another risk that cannot be overestimated. Just how great it is was highlighted yet again at the recent conference in Washington. For the fact is that stockpiles of weapons-grade fissile material now amount to some 2500 metric tons. These stockpiles are found in every part of the world and in many cases are not as securely safeguarded as one would like to think./////The threat they represent, however, is one that affects the Euro-Atlantic community as a whole. That's why we should make the most of this opportunity to cooperate./////The signing of the New START Treaty between the US and Russia in early April and the US Nuclear Posture Review will set the tone, we hope, for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in May and NATO's new Strategic Concept to be unveiled in November. We will be working hard to make arms control and disarmament top NATO priorities. As we see it, that means the role of nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence in NATO's overall strategy needs to be rethought and reduced./////Another step we would like to see-as proposed by President Obama in his speech after the signing of the New START Treaty-is the inclusion of sub-strategic nuclear weapons in future disarmament negotiations. At present they are not covered by any arms control mechanism. Twenty years after the end of East-West confrontation it must be possible to get rid of a Cold War relic that no longer serves any military purpose. That is the reason Germany wants to see all sub-strategic nuclear weapons still deployed on German territory removed. This must be done in close consultation with our NATO allies of course, we are not in favour of unilateral action here. When Minister Westerwelle raised this issue at the Meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers last week in Tallinn, the initial debate revealed differences of opinion on this of course. On the whole, however, the discussion was very constructive. It's important to make very clear in this connection that we also want to discuss with Russia how the very large number of Russian sub-strategic nuclear weapons can become part of the agenda of future disarmament negotiations./////For years now the technical know-how for manufacturing nuclear weapons and delivery systems has no longer been the exclusive, secret domain of a mere handful of countries. And for years now we've been faced by new security threats against which nuclear deterrence is meaningless. Now the dissemination of knowledge and technology as well as access to commodities has opened Pandora's box more than just a slit, the task we face today is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The crux here is how to make renouncing possession of nuclear weapons more attractive than their possession. That is one of today's greatest challenges and it's one we can only come to grips with effectively if we leave the relics of the Cold War behind us, including Cold War mindsets. This, too, is a challenge that is best tackled jointly by the Euro-Atlantic community as a whole./////And now let me wish you and all of us a very successful conference. I'm greatly looking forward to what you have to say. Thank you very much for your attention!/////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    22.10.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Minister of State Hoyer at the German-Polish-Russian Seminar at NATO, Brussels, 22.10.2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"__ translation of advanced text __/////Euro-Atlantic Security-Perceptions and Realities/////German-Polish-Russian Seminar at NATO: Enhanced Cooperation and Security For All __enewed Commitment/////Brussels, 22 October 2010/////It is a great pleasure for me to be able to participate in this trilateral seminar. Not too long ago it would have been difficult to imagine high-level representatives of the governments of Poland, Russia and Germany coming together within the framework of NATO to hold a joint seminar on issues of Euro-Atlantic security./////A positive development has begun in the past two years./////The conclusion of the New START Treaty in April of this year represented a major step. This milestone is based on the new trust between the Russian and US leaderships. We view President Obama's and President Medvedev's support for the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons as the commitment of both sides to further steps towards nuclear disarmament. The withdrawal of substrategic nuclear weapons is of particularly great importance to us Germans./////The Russian Government has taken significant steps towards building confidence in Europe. The resolution of the Barents Sea border issue with Norway represents an important increase in security. Let me give special attention to the rapprochement between Russia and Poland, which has led to a thaw in Russian-European relations in general and opens up new oppor­tunities for dialogue with Russia. Both sides are determined to overcome difficult past issues and look to the future./////It is to the credit of President Medvedev that his proposal for a new European security treaty has contributed significantly to a new perception of pan-European security. His initiative turned again to the unfulfilled promise of the Charter of Paris to establish indivisible security as the basis for mutual confidence and unified action./////A comprehensive dialogue within OSCE on Europe's common security has grown out of this. Numerous proposals for improved cooperation and security as well as for confidence-building have been developed as part of the Corfu Process. Now we must seize the opportunity that the OSCE Summit in Astana represents. The Astana Summit must provide concrete impulses and mandates aimed at strengthening common security in Europe./////To us, the concept of indivisible security, which President Medvedev has rightly emphasized, means the rejection of zero-sum logic. From our perspective the principle that security can be strengthened only in harmony, not in confrontation, means that greater security for the other side also implies greater security for oneself. To this end we must do away with the notion of spheres of influence and power, as it does not help us but, on the contrary, merely raises the spectre of new conflicts./////This thinking requires that both sides go the extra mile: For Russia this means over­coming the fear of its interests being impinged upon. We in the West have to try to place our trust in Russia's constructive role./////I have previously spoken of the need for a community of shared interests. Concrete steps of cooperation are needed to achieve this. Trust grows through joint action. In the area of Euro-Atlantic security I see this call going out especially to the NATO-Russia Council, EU__ussia relations and the OSCE./////Given the positive development of our relations, relations between NATO and Russia have also improved considerably. In Afghanistan, Russia and NATO have clear common interests in fighting terrorism, Islamist fundamentalism, and drug production and trafficking. Russia trains Afghans in the fight against drugs and also wants to provide Afghanistan with military equipment as part of an agreement with NATO. Russia's support for NATO in the transport of material and equipment to Afghanistan is also of particular importance./////There are also good prospects for cooperation between NATO and Russia to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. Agreement on the objectives has largely been reached in the NATO-Russia Council./////All in all, dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council has developed well since the Informal Foreign Ministers Meeting in Corfu. Thus I think there is a good chance of broadening the spectrum of topics. We, for example, are very open to the Russian proposal to conduct dialogue on defence planning. The field of reorganization of armed forces and joint military exercises on the basis of jointly elaborated threat scenarios also offers further scope for dialogue and cooperation./////How we address missile defence will be crucial for future relations between Russia and the West. Germany is a strong advocate of involving Russia as far as possible. We believe NATO-based missile defence can only further European security if Russia is on board. A call goes out here to NATO and Russia to use the opportunity for cooperation which would bring about a long-term and truly strategic improvement in NATO-Russia relations. Therefore I have read precisely the words of President Medwedew expressing readiness to explore ways by which Russia's active participation in a joint missile defence system might be possible./////The first step has been taken by drawing up a common threat analysis regarding joint missile defence in the NATO-Russia Council. But I see much further-reaching potential, from the passing on of technical information, knowing how sensitive the issue is, via the joint development of components, to the inter­connection of the surveillance and defence systems in the various areas./////At the forthcoming Summit in Lisbon, NATO will adopt its New Strategic Concept and therein commit to its partnership with Russia, in very clear and credible terms. ""Partners, not adversaries"" should also be the maxim for the Russian percep­tion of NATO. Were Russia to deal accordingly with NATO in its military and security doctrines, it would be an encouraging confidence-building response./////The German government is highly delighted that President Medvedev agreed to a NATO-Russia Council Summit in Lisbon. This provides a real opportunity for the two sides to move closer together./////Russia's cooperation with the EU is the other key component in relations between Russia and the West./////Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union. The European Union needs Russia just as Russia needs the European Union. This holds true not only in the business sphere and regarding energy security, but also in the sphere of security policy./////With the Treaty of Lisbon and the establishment of the European External Action Service, the European Union is putting its common foreign policy and the effectiveness of it on a new footing. This presents new opportunities for closer and more operational foreign and security policy collaboration between the EU and Russia. The EU is interested in conducting this kind of security dialogue and is prepared to raise it to a new level./////The Meseberg Initiative of President Medvedev and Federal Chancellor Merkel has been an important trigger in lending a new quality to security policy relations. Linked to this is the plan to move forward together on resolving the Transnistria conflict. Transnistria is cer­tainly a kind of test-drive of our ability to jointly overcome mutual blockades. Russian influence is vital given its financial, military and political support. But Romania is also called upon to help bring about a solution./////Progress in Transnistria would step up confidence considerably and lend weight to Presi­dent Medvedev's call for indivisible security in Europe. Such progress would also be a promising signal for the OSCE Summit in Astana. After all, it is at this Summit that key momentum is needed for the development of a pan-European security order./////Such momentum clearly also includes elements to prompt a strengthening and renewal of conventional arms control in Europe./////Adapting and modernizing the CFE Treaty is a sine qua non for creating European security and a major confidence-building step between Russia and its Western neighbours./////A successful development of the CFE negotiations with a view to a Treaty ratified by all parties would also have a positive impact on the issue of NATO's and Russia's substrategic nuclear weapons in Europe. You know that my Government is working for the withdrawal of NATO's tactical nuclear weapons from Germany and Europe-an issue we are consulting intensively with our Allies. From a military and security policy perspective they do not make sense any longer. But we also consider it essential for Russia to with­draw its much larger arsenals of substrategic nuclear weapons from Europe. First steps could be transparency measures and central storage of warheads./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    24.11.2010 - Interview,"Interview with Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Rheinische Post of 24 November 2010 on the NATO Summit, the euro and Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ",Interview,"Question: For the first time NATO has made disarmament one of its stated goals. What good will that do us?/////I'm pushing so hard on disarmament because it's good for our own security. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are closely connected. We must prevent a situation in which more and more countries acquire nuclear weapons and eventually even terrorists get their hands on them. Disarmament is as vital for humanity as climate protection. After a decade of armament, it's time to launch a decade of disarmament./////Question: Is a world without nuclear weapons anything more than an illusion?/////It's a vision, but unlike a former German Chancellor, I believe we need visions in politics if we want to achieve anything long-term. Our Christian Democrat-Liberal coalition received a mandate to govern and it's our job to do what's right for our country. Disarmament is security policy, which is why it's a good thing this is now also NATO's business. Never before has disarmament been so high on NATO's agenda./////Question: At the NATO Summit Russia and Europe saw eye to eye in a way they never have in the past./////That the Russian President has been invited by NATO to participate in developing a joint missile defence system is a historic step. I was born in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built. I'd not yet turned 30 when courageous people in East Germany tore it down. Now, 20 years after German unity, those who during the Cold War confronted each other armed to the teeth are no longer adversaries but sit around the same table. That's a huge success./////Question: Can Russia become our friend, in the same way as France?/////The idea of friendship between Russia, Europe and us Germans is one we should cherish in our hearts. Partnership and modernization, however, must encompass more than merely economic matters. On freedom of expression and freedom of the press, on civil rights and the rule of law there are differences of opinion. Despite this, I feel we're on the right track./////Question: The euro crisis goes on and on.Can it put the European Union's political existence at risk?/////First of all, it's clear how right it was to put the rescue package in place. And how wrong the Opposition was, after the Red-Green coalition had watered down the Stability Pact, to then refuse to tackle the consequences of this historic mistake. Unlike early on with Greece, we are actually now prepared and we have a tool for managing the situation. I see no risk of contagion, by the way, as every case is different. What's important is for a rigorous policy of budget consolidation to be pursued everywhere in Europe./////Question: Is it conceivable for you that bankrupt countries will be forced to leave the European Union?/////No. Europe is the most successful peace project in the history of our continent, it's the insurance policy that keeps us prosperous. The euro is a currency of peace. It would be crazy for us Germans of all people to forget how important Europe is for us. That we can live in peace in this European house of ours is a great boon. If you share a house with 26 other people, of course you're sometimes annoyed by the loud music or the chores left undone. What's crucial, however, is to strengthen the foundations of our house. For that we need an effective crisis mechanism and a tightening-up of the Stability Pact. This must include effective sanctions as well as, from 2013 on, the involvement of private-sector creditors. To make the taxpayer liable for any and every investment risk is just not on./////Question: In Afghanistan troop withdrawal is now drawing nearer.What happens if Afghan President Hamid Karzai asks Germany to stay longer?/////It was the Afghan Government that set itself the goal of taking full responsibility for national security by 2014. We are supporting Afghan efforts here, for that's how withdrawal of our troops will become a concrete prospect. The mission in Afghanistan can't go on for ever. If the handover is successful, the last combat troops should leave the country in 2014. This doesn't mean, however, that from then on we won't be taking any responsibility in Afghanistan for things like civilian development or security forces training./////(...)/////The interviewers wereMichael Brocker and Gregor Mayntz./////",0.1
Nuclear weapon,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Uruguayan weekly ""Busqueda"" - Federal Foreign Office ",Statement,"Germany's economic recovery is not yet stable, and the signals remain contradictory. What is your government's prediction for the rest of this year?/////Exports are rising again, and the German labour market remains resilient. We are sure that the economic recovery will continue in Germany, and we are trying to back this up at national and European level-domestically, we are creating growth impulses by reducing the burden on families and medium-sized businesses./////In 2010 the EU will begin implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, resulting in a major transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the Union in the security and external relations fields. Is it possible to continue that process in the middle of an economic crisis which negatively impacts a large part of the continent?/////Europe's economic and financial crisis management has nothing to do with our efforts to cooperate even more closely on foreign and security policy. I agree that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to major changes in Europe's foreign policy, above all in institutional terms. By combining foreign-policy responsibilities we have the opportunity to present ourselves to a much greater extent as a single actor. The revamped format of ""High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy"", a post Catherine Ashton took over three months ago, will give the EU greater effectiveness and visibility./////Doesn't the fact that some countries fail to adhere to the Maastricht criteria on the coordination of macroeconomic policy make the European economic system less credible?/////The Lisbon Treaty imposes clear requirements on the eurozone members regarding new indebtedness and the level of debt. The Commission makes sure that these requirements are met, and it has the necessary sanction options to bring a member back into line. In my view this system has very much proved its worth, and it is a major factor in the eurozone financial framework's credibility./////The financial crisis which has had serious effects in countries like Greece and Spain, where the central banks are under suspicion for their handling of figures and financial statements regarding budget deficits and debts, has for the first time posed a challenge to the common currency, the euro. What measures will your country propose should this manipulation of data be confirmed?/////Unfortunately, with regard to Greece, it is now clear that the budget and debt figures have been incorrectly reported over a lengthy period. We have to learn the right lessons from this. It is already clear that the Commission, the eurozone members and Eurostat will need to examine national financial data much more closely in future, and that more decisive action must be taken to clarify even the slightest signs of possible irregularities./////This year China will for the first time overtake Germany as the world's leading export nation. How will your country react, in view of the expansion of China and other emerging countries?/////Germany will remain a strong exporting nation, of that I have no doubt. It is of secondary importance whether or not we are still export world champion. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We must maintain our competitiveness and aim for technological leadership. With innovative, high-quality products and technology-for example in the energy, biotechnology and telecommunications sectors-we will bolster our export strength./////For a long time Europe and the United States ignored the lack of democracy and freedoms in China. Has the time now come to confront Beijing with these issues?/////Germany champions freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide, and that is why we openly discuss the difficult situation faced by civil-rights campaigners and dissidents in China or the Tibetans' right to their cultural identity. This was the case during my last visit to Beijing, and it will continue to be the case in future./////Germany is a member of the group of negotiators trying to persuade Iran to abandon its current nuclear development plan. A recent UN report shows that this Islamic state is progressing towards the production of weapons of mass destruction. Does Germany feel the moment has arrived for strict sanctions against the Tehran regime? What kind of sanctions does Germany have in mind?/////While Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes, it cannot arm itself with nuclear weapons. This is why the international negotiating group pursues a dual-track approach, offering Iran broad cooperation in the economic and technological fields in return for an opening by Iran and fulfilment of the international community's demands. Failing this, we reserve the right to take further measures. Germany is also prepared to extend the sanctions should Iran continue to spurn our outstretched hand./////In Cuba a political prisoner has just died during a hunger strike. Do you think Europe should change its policy towards those Latin American countries which fail to fully respect human rights?/////We were greatly saddened at the tragic death of Orlando Zapata that should not have happened. The Cuban Government must finally release all political prisoners and grant international humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails. Standing up for human rights is, by the way, one of the central tenets of German and European foreign policy-also of course with regard to Latin America./////The EU and Mercosur have returned to the negotiating table to make further progress towards signing a free trade agreement. Can an agreement even be reached, given the current economic uncertainty? And can Europe amend its agricultural policy, as called for by Mercosur, in order to conclude an agreement?/////We want an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement with Mercosur. It would be of great value at this particular time, when both sides are keen to stimulate their economies again. As far as European agricultural policy is concerned, there is an important link between the free trade agreement and the Doha Round, which we want to succeed. That is why the EU has made an advance concession and undertaken considerable efforts to ensure improved market access for agricultural products. Progress in the Doha Round would undoubtedly bring progress in the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement too./////What expectations does the German Government have of the Uruguayan Government led by Jose Mujica?/////President Mujica has made clear what the priorities of his term in office will be-creating jobs, combating poverty and undertaking further educational and health-care reforms. Germany wants to further extend its bilateral relations with Uruguay, and following my talks with President Mujica I know that in him Germany has an open and committed interlocutor./////Is Germany concerned that the new Uruguayan Government has announced gestures of rapprochement towards regimes such as that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela?/////Every country has the right to shape its own relations. I don't see anything unusual in Uruguay and Venezuela, two regional partners, being in contact. Uruguay is a member of Mercosur, while Venezuela is on its way to membership./////The German foreign ministry has urged its Uruguayan counterpart to make sure that the Nazi eagle salvaged from the Graf Spee, which still lies wrecked on the bed of the Rio de la Plata, is not exhibited. What is the reason behind this stance, given that in Germany Nazi symbols are exhibited as part of its culture of remembrance? What did you request that the new foreign minister do in this regard?/////We want to prevent parts of the wreckage, and above all the stern eagle and swastika, from entering the militaria trade. Only in this way can we make sure that the wreckage is not misused to glorify or trivialize Nazi thinking. We are of course keen to shed more light on historical events surrounding the Graf Spee, and we therefore propose that the wreckage be exhibited, on the authority of the Uruguayan State, in its proper historical context./////",0.1

International trade,    03.06.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the German-Arab Business Forum of the Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Federal Foreign Office ,forum,"/////Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is a great pleasure to be here tonight./////I have experienced great Arab hospitality already twice this year. In January, I had the pleasure to visit Riyadh, Doha, Abu Dhabi and Sanaa. My second trip led me to Beirut, Cairo, Amman, and Damascus just two weeks ago. I hope your stay in Berlin will be as unforgettable as my recent trips./////I would like to welcome you all to Berlin./////The German government works hand in hand and on all levels to promote industry and trade. This is a priority for our chancellor, Angela Merkel, for my colleague and good friend, the Minister of Economics and Technology, Rainer Brderle, and for me./////We lay a special focus on the promotion of a strong role of small and medium-sized companies in international trade. These companies are the backbone of the German economy./////Promoting business activities abroad is good for both sides. We contribute to more prosperity at home, protecting existing jobs and creating new jobs. We also contribute to more prosperity for our partners, who benefit from diversification of their local production and from modernisation of their infrastructure.//////////In my remarks today, do not expect me to paint a picture of the variety of Germany's economic and political ties with the Arab world. That picture would be incomplete at best. There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" way of doing business for German companies that applies to all Arab countries that are represented here today./////The economic ties between Germany and the Arab world have developed dramatically during the last decade./////In 2008, the value of goods and services exported from Germany to the Arab world is almost three times higher than at the beginning of the new millennium./////Of course, the financial crisis has had its effects. Last year was not a good year for world trade. But while the overall volume in external trade fell everywhere, the reduction was less strong with the Arab world than with other regions. And all indicators show that this year will be a year of growth./////Arab countries develop long-term strategies to shape modern economies for the 21st century. State-owned funds in the Gulf states aim at diversifying local industry. Their goal is to reduce dependency on volatile prices for natural resources and to preserve the national wealth for future generations./////German companies can be great companions on that path. They are experienced with large infrastructure projects. They are experts in construction, electricity networks and water supply, streets and railroads, to name only a few./////They are experienced with building refineries, developing petrochemicals, steel, aluminium, logistics and tourism. The Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a perfect meeting ground to talk about business and to explore future opportunities./////Our cooperation is not a one-way-street. As an export-oriented nation, Germany needs open markets. And we are open for investments./////Germany has profited from the Euro in the past. We are committed to protect the Euro and to keep it strong. You can be sure that your investments are in good hands. In response to the bitter experience with inflation in the first half of the 20thcentury, Germany has created a culture of stability for our currency so that this will never happen again./////Now we face the challenge to balance the federal budget. There will be cuts in the budget, but we will protect the investments in education and technology. These are investments in our future, in the bright minds of tomorrow./////Germany's economic ties with the Arab world get stronger every day. I believe we need to further strengthen our political ties, too. We cannot afford to be bystanders of globalization. We need to shape globalization./////The global economic and financial crisis has not slowed or even halted the globalization process. To the contrary, the effects of the economic and financial crisis show that globalization advances. Events that take place in distant corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food. We can only achieve sustainable solutions together./////There is also a bright light in all the difficulties. We have seen that the world is better prepared than ever to cope with challenges to the global economy./////The International Monetary Fund, the IMF, has contributed to the solution./////The World Trade Organisation with its dispute settlement mechanism helps us stop the impulse to resort to protectionism./////I believe we need more of this culture of cooperation. We need cooperation on the global level, on the level of the United Nations. And we need cooperation between regions. For centuries, the Mediterranean trade has linked Europe with the Arab world. And trade still links us today. The Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry is the perfect meeting point./////Thank you very much.//////////",0.3
International trade,    29.03.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Federal Minister Westerwelle at the Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, 29 March 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __//////////Lieber Herr Breitschwerdt,/////Ihnen und den Mitgliedern der deutsch-kanadischen Handelskammer ganz herzlichen Dank fr die Einladung zu diesem Festakt.//////////Minister Pupatello, Minister Van Loan,/////President Naylor,/////It is a real honour and pleasure to be here with you. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today at this eminent University, in this dynamic city, in this huge province and beautiful country./////Canada is known worldwide as a tolerant and open-minded country. As host of the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games Canada was the focus for all sports fans around the world. Let me thank Canada for such wonderful Games. Once more Canada has lived up to its high reputation and presented itself as a wonderful host. And I am happy to congratulate Canada on its first position in the medal table. By the way, Germany came in second./////Ladies and Gentlemen,/////In purely geographical terms Canada and Germany are far apart. But when it comes to our values and our interests Canada and Germany are very close. Our two countries share the same fundamental values. These include democracy and the rule of law, the need for international cooperation and the primacy of international law. We share a similar understanding of the value of individual freedom. All of these values bind us together./////To defend these common values Canadian Forces were based in Germany for four decades. From 1954 to 1994 Canadian men and women helped us to confront Communism along the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. More than 400.000 Canadians lived in Germany to protect our shared free and democratic ideals. We thank you for your staunch support and your strong friendship./////And it was here in Canada, in Ottawa, at the Open Skies Conference in 1990, that the process of negotiating the Two plus Four Agreement was started. This year we celebrate with gratitude the 20th anniversary of German Unification./////That you had an event here to commemorate the beginning of the Two plus Four process is something I really appreciate./////Let me assure you: The German people will not forget the part Canada played in bringing down the Berlin Wall and in the unification of our country. Some people speak of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, but the Wall did not fall, people brought it down. We will always be very grateful to Canada./////German foreign policy is value-based and interest-led. That is not a contradiction but the two sides of the same coin. The German-Canadian relationship reflects this combination in a unique manner. Our relationship is not only based on shared values, but also on shared interests./////Both our countries are major economic powers, both are heavily dependent on exports. More than many other countries Germany and Canada have to be concerned about the lurking dangers of protectionism. All countries profit from free trade. But more than elsewhere our prosperity is a result of free access to foreign markets./////Both of us face competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Our two countries cannot-and don't want to-compete on salaries or social and environmental standards with those countries. The cheaper the products from those countries, the better and more advanced our products have to be. More than many other countries Canada and Germany have to stay at the forefront of research and development to maintain prosperity./////This year we celebrate one hundred years of Canadian-German trade relations./////Today our bilateral annual trade volume adds up to more than 10 billion Euros. The EU is Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. Canadian-German trade relations are a success story. But there is still potential for further growth./////As Minister for Foreign Affairs I intend to support German business with every means at my disposal. Soon after taking office I saw to it that strategies were developed with the aim of enhancing Germany's external economic policy. We want to open up external economic promotion to other sectors and make it more attractive to small and medium__ized companies in particular. These form the backbone of the German economy. Let me assure you: I will pursue external economic promotion not with timidity but with vigor. In other words, I will do it the Canadian way. It is no accident that your foreign ministry is called ""Department for Foreign Affairs and International Trade""./////In a globalized world it is not enough for countries like Canada and Germany just to expand their trade volume. We have to deepen our trade relations./////That is why in 2007, when Germany held the Presidency of the European Union, we lobbied hard to get the EU to work with Canada on a ""Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement"". Both sides have been doing their homework. Formal discussions have begun and are going well. They take us into new territory for our bilateral relations. To meet the goals we have set, we have to look at investment rules; at provincial as well as federal government procurement; at regulations; at intellectual property rights; at local competition policies; at labour and environment issues. We may not be able to agree on everything but a substantial agreement will not only be a major boost to Canadian-European trade, but also to the German and Canadian position on the global market./////Both our countries will only be able to keep their positions at the forefront of prosperous states if we make sure that we maintain our position at the high end of the value chain./////To do that, we have to invest heavily in education, in innovation, in science and in research and in development. The answer is to use our advantages, to bring out the very best that we can offer to the world. And, more and more, that is something we do in partnership with other countries./////Just one example: Research in Motion and their latest Blackberry: They came up with a keyboard that is very small and still easy to use because every single letter is cleverly and differently shaped. That was invented at RIM's new facility in Bochum, Germany./////And there are many other similar examples./////By combining the best of research and science in many countries we stay competitive in a globalized world. In that respect, Germany, the EU and Canada have a lot to offer each other./////Education is the number one priority in both our countries. The new German government will invest an extra 12 billion Euro in education, research and development. But improving educational institutions is not only a question of money. It is also a question of structures./////Business schools have long talked about ""best practices"". Learning from each other about what works and what does not./////One very good example of ""best practices"" is the award given in 2008 by the Bertelsmann Foundation, one of the most prestigious institutions in Germany, to the Toronto District School Board for its work in providing fair and equal opportunities for all children. At the awards ceremony, the Foundation said: ""The school system in Toronto shows us what actions we have to take, considering the challenges we are facing from globalization, migration and demographic change"". Using the experience of Toronto, the Foundation has launched its own programme in Germany called ""Integration Through Education""./////I think this is the way forward. As the challenges we face grow more complex, we all profit from looking for solutions also beyond our borders./////The global economic and financial crisis has not led to a slowing down or halt in the globalization process. The effects of the economic and financial crisis are, in fact, the expression of advancing globalization. Events that take place in far-flung corners of the globe directly affect us. The same rule applies to the economy and financial affairs, the environment, climate change, energy and food: we can only achieve sustainable solutions together if we cooperate at a global level./////We need to work together on defusing conflicts before they escalate, using preventive foreign policy. In order to do this we need to address the roots of these problems. Where are conflicts more likely because of a lack of resources? How can we use our foreign policy and economic tools to prevent these conflicts? Our foreign policy must prevent global problems from turning into global crises. Today foreign policy must ensure that globalization develops on the basis of a set of rules and values. Let me underline this: Our shared goal must be to give globalization a set of rules and values so that peace, security and prosperity are safeguarded in the long term./////Here we see Canada as a natural partner, because we share the same fundamental values and interests./////As I am travelling to the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today, let me point out just two topics Canada and Germany are dealing with side by side right now at the global level://///Both Germany and Canada have a strong interest in nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. As countries that do not possess nuclear weapons we want to contribute to strengthening the international regime against the proliferation of nuclear weapons while making nuclear technology available for peaceful uses. I am therefore pleased that the Canadian G8 Presidency has made non-proliferation a priority issue at our meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers today and tomorrow./////A related and very important issue at the G8 meeting will be the nuclear dispute with Iran. We are very concerned about Iran's unwillingness and inability to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. I would like to underline that we are not against Iran using nuclear power for the peaceful production of energy. We have offered a generous package of assistance in exchange for assurances. But the Iranian leadership should understand that we cannot and will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. It would constitute a major threat to regional stability but it would also undermine the global non-proliferation regime. Our hand to Iran remains outstretched. But in the absence of a response and real progress the international community has to prepare stronger sanctions against Iran. We will discuss the situation and the way forward at our meeting tomorrow./////Canada and Germany are long term partners, on the bilateral and the global level./////We may be on two different continents but on the major challenges of our time we stand as one./////Over the last century our relations have been deepened, improved and strengthened. I am very optimistic that we will continue in that direction in the future. Not only because our governments agree upon many topics, but because of the deep friendship between our peoples./////Thank you very much./////",0.2
International trade,    25.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the United Nations General Assembly (25.09.10) - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__translation of advance text__//////////Mr President, Mr Secretary-General,Distinguished colleagues,Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,/////It is an honour for me to speak to you today./////The world has changed dramatically since the United Nations was founded 65 years ago. International trade and exchange is of course nothing new. What is new is how quickly the changes affect everybody's lives. Only if we in the United Nations are and remain able to act can we shape these global changes./////We will only manage to solve problems relating to security, economic, social and ecological development if the international community stands united./////Germany is ready to assume global responsibility within the framework set by the United Nations. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in the international community./////In Europe, a system of cooperation has replaced the confrontation that cruelly divided our continent for centuries. The European Union is successful because in Europe all peoples and states meet on an equal footing./////The United Nations, too, brings together nations both large and small, rich and poor, those that are more powerful and those with less influence. Cooperation on an equal footing, cooperation between equals, is our guiding principle also for work here at the United Nations./////Each and every country must respect all others./////Mr President,/////German foreign policy is peace policy. This autumn, Germany will stand for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, because this is an ideal forum in which to cooperate in the cause of peace and development./////Peace is more than the absence of war. In today's globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, poverty and under-development as they are to violence and oppression./////Mr President,/////Climate change has a direct impact on each and every one of us. Countless people are already personally feeling its economic and social consequences./////In their letter to the Security Council, the Pacific island states rightly warned us in no uncertain terms just how much climate change threatens everyone's security./////Everybody must play their part to protect the climate. In Germany we have just adopted a forward-looking energy strategy. By the year 2050 80% of our electricity production will come from renewable sources./////Germany has also pledged to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020 compared tothe 1990 baseline. Even now, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by almost 30%. We are pioneers in the field of climate protection./////We are helping those who are now worst affected by climate change. We are particularly concerned about the fate of small island states./////Anyone who's serious about combatting climate change has to build on innovation, new technologies and exchange. Both developed and developing nations can profit from cooperation on future energies. Germany will contribute its technological expertise, for example in the fields of renewable energies and energy efficiency./////In this way we'returning the challenge of climate change into an opportunity for fair development and enhanced cooperation. Climate policy is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy. The Summit on the Millennium Development Goals laid down the next steps forward in our global partnership for development./////Mr President,/////Education is the key to development, development needs education. Education protects people from discrimination and oppression. Education fights prejudices and thereby fosters peace. But education also creates products and markets, education is the path to prosperity./////The true wealth of many nations is no longer found in their raw materials, but in the minds of their people. Education is a human right./////It is because education will determine whether societies succeed or fail in tomorrow's world that Germany is one of the major international partners for learning. By building on education, we are building bridges to the future for the young people of today./////Mr President,/////The United Nations itself must also keep up with the pace of change. The world order of today is not properly reflected if Africa and Latin America are not permanently represented on the Security Council. Asia, too, rightly considers itself to be under-represented. The entire continent, not just individual states, is developing at breath-taking speed./////We take our partnerships seriously, both the old and the new./////Germany, too, remains ready to assume greater responsibility./////Mr President,/////Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are not issues of the past, but challenges of our time. Disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. We have to do all we possibly can to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////Unlike the Conference five years ago, this May's Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a success. If we work together to maintain this momentum, it will be in our power to ensure that this decade does not see a build-up of arms but becomes a decade of disarmament./////A world without nuclear weapons is a long-term vision, but even a marathon begins with the first step./////There is now movement in the disarmament debate. The group of states founded here in New York on Wednesday to advance disarmament and arms control does not stand alone./////For over ten years the Geneva Conference on Disarmament wasn't even able to agree on an agenda./////This is not the way to live up to our shared responsibility. We met yesterday at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General to break the deadlock affecting the Geneva Conference./////Our world will be a more secure place when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty enters into force and the production of fissile material is ended once and for all./////Mr President,/////German peace policy stands for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Germany is doing its utmost to ensure that the direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are a success./////We will continue to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation./////During this vital period for the peace process, in particular, I urge both sides to refrain from taking any action which might block the path to peace./////We condemn any form of violence which has the sole aim of torpedoing the peace talks. At the same time we call for the moratorium on settlement construction to be extended./////Lasting peace will only be achieved through a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living peacefully side by side within secure borders./////Mr President,/////Iran, like every other country, naturally has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the Tehran leadership itself has sown doubt about the civilian nature of its nuclear programme. Iran, by demonstrating openness and transparency, can allay that doubt. Our offer of dialogue still stands. It's now up to Iran to grasp our outstretched hand./////Mr President,/////The conference aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, planned for 2012, is a major opportunity to strengthen peace and security in the region./////Germany is encouraging all countries in the region to take part so that the conference is a success. We are committed to a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East./////Mr President,/////Germany is one of the major supporters of a peaceful and secure Afghanistan. As we agreed in London and Kabul, we want to transfer security responsibility for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan Government by 2014./////To make progress in this country, for so long ravaged by war and civil strife, effective measures must be taken to prevent the violence. However, military means alone will not bring success. We favour a holistic approach and above all a political solution./////All sides now need the courage and the stamina to engage in reconciliation./////Mr President,/////The German Government assists when people anywhere in the world are struck by natural disasters and emergencies./////But a country's conscience is to be found in its citizens' hearts. I'm proud that my fellow Germans donate so generously at times of greatest need./////Humanity and solidarity are global values, humanity and solidarity make no distinction based on skin colour or religious beliefs./////When the tsunami devastated coastlines around the Indian Ocean, when the Haiti earthquake destroyed the work of decades, or just recently, when the horrific floods in Pakistan left havoc in their wake, we Germans shared the victims' pain and helped in the most heartfelt way possible./////We will stand by Pakistan over the coming months and years so that the country has a good economic future./////Mr President,/////We are working towards a peaceful order in Sudan, now and after the referendum early next year. We are looking for ways of achieving stable conditions in Yemen and are particularly active in the Friends of Yemen group. We are working hard to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa and bring peace and stability to Somalia./////Reconstruction efforts in devastated regions cannot bring success overnight. Equally, for societies torn by war and civil strife, the route to life in dignity leads via peace and reconciliation./////There can only be true peace when human rights are respected. For us principles such as the rule of law, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, and respect for inalienable human rights, are essential. The protection of human rights remains a task for all societies./////It is a fundamental tenet of the UN that women determine their own lives and help decide the fate of their countries./////Ethnic or religious minorities are an enrichment./////Tolerance is one of Germany's guiding principles./////Everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas, in a clash of cultures there can only be losers./////Mr President,/////United Europe can make a valuable contribution, on our continent and beyond./////Germany is working to ensure that in the future the European Union cooperates even more closely with other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and lives up to its global responsibility./////Germany is the third-largest development cooperation donor. We have practically recovered from the financial and economic crisis and we are on the right track due to our robust economic growth. This strong economy makes Germany a strong global partner./////If all countries, both small and large, work together, we will be able to masterthe pressing challenges of our world./////You can rely on Germany./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
International trade,    07.09.2010 - Speech,Opening speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the Business Forum at the 2010 Ambassadors Conference in Berlin on 7 September 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advance text __//////////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I am absolutely delighted to be able to welcome so many of you here to the Weltsaal at the Federal Foreign Office. I have been told that interest in the Business Forum at the Ambassadors Conference has never been as great as this year. This I find very gratifying, as it suggests you are optimistic about our country's opportunities and about its economic development./////I should like to extend a very warm welcome to the President of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services, Mr Anton Borner. Thank you very much for agreeing to address our Business Forum./////I would also like to welcome the top man at the Federal Economics Ministry, Federal Economics Minister Rainer Brderle, acting for the first time as something of a joint host at this event with us at the Federal Foreign Office. This is the first time that we, in our capacities as Economics Minister and Foreign Minister, have opened this Business Forum together. And I am delighted, Rainer, that you will be speaking to our many guests here today./////That, too, is undoubtedly an expression of cooperation. Allow me to welcome our many guests of honour, particularly of course the representatives of the parliamentary groups in the German Bundestag. A warm welcome to all the dignitaries. Protocol would require that they should all be welcomed personally, but in the interest of keeping things short, I will mention just one of their number. It is a privilege to welcome former Federal Economics Minister Professor Helmut Haussmann here today./////This Business Forum is taking place at a time when the German economy is very clearly recovering, catching up, regaining its old strength. After all, Germany's strength in the world primarily depends not on our military capability or the strength of our forces, although these are all important. No, it is Germany's economic strength which is the key to our influence and possibilities in the world. Germany's strength and international image depend not on military capacities, but first and foremost on diplomatic skill, on responsibility and humanity, and on our economic power. Together, these make up our political and moral authority in the world. And that is why I am particularly keen for foreign policy, too, to play its part in ensuring our country's economic success. When German foreign policy says it wants to promote economic opportunities for German businesses in the world, it may at first seem rather suspect to many people. In other countries, ambassadors and politicians, and even foreign ministers, would be criticized if they did not help their own economy to be successful. But in our case, sometimes, things go in precisely the opposite direction. And to my mind it is important to overcome this. Just as our close friends, our European neighbours, regard it as obvious that politics should open doors in the world for the country's own companies, the same must become obvious in Germany. And some of these debates we are having-and here I don't only mean the debates of recent weeks, but those of recent months as well-about whether politics is the business world's lackey when it tries to improve business opportunities-would be absolutely inconceivable in other countries in Europe no less sovereign or democratic than we are, no less structured and oriented to the rule of law./////Quite simply, the reality is that things in the world are shifting. We are living in a time of upheaval. A time of global upheaval. Things we are concerned with here in Germany, demographic development for instance, have to be discussed beyond the boundaries of national issues at global level: demographic development, i.e. changing age structures in society in Germany, in Europe, in comparison with other young continents. After all, this demographic development is not merely a challenge for us, for our national social security systems. It is also a challenge for foreign policy, because it is just a question of time until the young societies, those booming, dynamic societies which twenty years ago were shrugged off as developing countries, having become major emerging nations, also demand to be political, cultural and intellectual centres. These countries, these regions, won't be content just to sell us resources and have us sell them products. Rather, they will want a say in ""big politics"". That is why, although the G8 is certainly an important format, we are all aware that the G20 is becoming more and more important as a format for shaping globalization. Countries which, twenty years ago, or in my student days, really were still developing countries are now joining us as equal partners at international level at the round table or negotiating table. And not just when it comes to the area for which Rainer Brderle is responsible, namely economic policy, but also, of course, when it comes to the Middle East or crisis regions, or global issues. A country like Turkey, for example, regards its tremendous economic development as entitling it to have a say on other issues. That's what we're experiencing just now, not least in discussions on strategic orientation in Turkey. A country like Brazil, for example, with its amazing success story of recent years, not only claims the right to speak with us on economic issues, most recently at the German-Brazilian Economic Forum in Munich, but also, when President Lula or soon his successor appears on the world stage, then with the authority of his own economy, his own society. He goes to the Middle East, for instance, and tries to make his mark on the peace process./////Brazil, Argentina, China-all these upcoming countries are, of course, to a certain extent new competitors for us. But first and foremost they embody huge opportunities. They are markets for German products. And we are working hard to make these countries Germany's partners when it comes to peace, security and prosperity in the world too./////As an export nation, Germany needs to keep a very close eye on developments in the world. And I'm quite sure that Rainer Brderle, as Economics Minister and as one who has many years-actually, ungallant as it may be to say it-decades of experience in international politics, will be saying something about the markets, about the possibilities for cooperation. But what I am also concerned with is partnership that goes beyond economic considerations, partnership which emerges from positive economic development to bring stability, prosperity and peace./////With its 229 missions abroad, the Foreign Service is a true global network. And all the heads of mission you might talk to here today also have a dense network of contacts in their host country. They know who to talk to and can help open doors./////This may not be very important for a huge, globally operating company with tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of staff. Big companies like that are able to establish their own representations to conquer markets all around the world. But the many small and medium-sized enterprises are highly dependent on finding open doors at the chambers of commerce abroad, but also at our diplomatic missions, so that our diplomatic missions can in turn open other doors for them. These smaller companies are not in a position to keep up a dense network of representatives and offices around the world. That is why a sensible external economic affairs policy is predominantly in the interest of SMEs. And, incidentally, in the interest of their workers and the jobs they create./////The environmentfor exports and investments abroad certainly hasn't got any easier. In fact, in some countries it has become much more complicated./////German companies and German products are highly regarded abroad. ""Made in Germany"" was once intended as a taint on German products. But for a long time now ""Made in Germany"" has been a sign of the quality of German firms. What's behind ""Made in Germany""? What do people think of when they read that? Firstly, quality and reliability. And this reputation for reliability which German products rightly have is one which German politics needs to have abroad too, because the two go together. This is our excellent calling card./////So the economic sphere presents a great opportunity for our country, and expressly also for foreign policy. Foreign policy is globalization policy. I don't simply mean globalization of markets; I am calling for a comprehensive interpretation of globalization. It is also a matter of the globalization of values./////When we talk about globalization in Germany, we occasionally let fall the disparaging word ""globalism"". A real process is turned into an ""ism"", an ideology. As if we could just close our eyes and the rest of the world would immediately show consideration to Germany and Central Europe. You all know that this is not the case. Indeed, everyone in this country feels that this is not the case. But somehow we haven't yet really taken it on board. Globalization isn't just about trade, the exchange of goods, economic relations; no, globalization is also about the spread of values, of the rule of law. And the businesspeople gathered here today know full well that the rule of law is not just a human rights or civil rights goal which stirs our hearts; rather, it is of course also a question of reliability. Countries which cannot give their own citizens rule of law structures will not be regarded as reliable sites for investment. There is a connection here too. This is not the primacy of economics in human and civil rights, but rather it is the idea that countries with a rule of law deficit have to have it made clear to them: it is right for you, for your development, to embrace the rule of law and to completely accept and practise human rights./////Of course it is also a matter of modern infrastructure in developing and emerging economies, or of easier access to water and electricity. But this is not merely an act of humanity. Nor is it merely altruism, solidarity between individuals, solidarity between nations and countries; rather it is also a chance to get orders for German companies in the energy or infrastructure sector. Having visited many countries in my first few months in office, I can tell you that Germany has an extremely good reputation./////Development and prosperity in turn lead to stability, security and peace in the world. Economic development stabilizes societies. Increasing prosperity, particularly in poorer countries, stabilizes societies and inclines them more to peace. Wherever people have no chance to make anything of their lives, wherever people are in despair, they are naturally vulnerable to extremism and then also fundamentalism and terrorism. This is one of the reasons why we at the Federal Foreign Office put so much effort into handling crisis regions. It is not just because it is, in a way, a debt to humanity, but also because it is in our own interest to bear in mind the link between stabilization and economic and social opportunities in these countries, and thus also a peaceful world./////Latin America is one of Germany's partner regions. Four weeks ago, the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America Strategy. We want to raise our relations with the continent to a new qualitative level. Latin America is the key focus of this year's Ambassadors Conference. We share common values with many countries in the region. This is the solid foundation for increased cooperation. Germany should participate in the mood of change and the amazing dynamism to be seen on the continent. The opportunities and potential of enhanced cooperation with Latin America are far from exhausted. I propose an annual meeting of businesspeople and diplomats along the lines of the annual conference of the Asia-Pacific Committee, where we can develop concrete initiatives for increased cooperation with Latin America. We are ready to do this./////We are thinking beyond large-scale natural resources. We know, for example, that a country like Brazil is hugely committed to renewable energies. Here we can contribute German cutting-edge technologies. These are important cooperation projects from which everyone, but especially our partners, will benefit./////Over the next few months and years, I predict, Latin America will come more and more to the fore. The world will be looking to Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. And we saw ourselves with our ""summer fairytale"" just how a major sporting event like that can change a country's image. Suddenly the world realized that we Germans can be cheerful and uninhibited (though we always knew it of ourselves), and that Germany can have good weather (though we know, of course, that that's always the case). Overnight, Germany's image in the world changed completely, as many of you experienced. The same thing happened this summer with South Africa. Think back to everything the esteemed observers and critics wrote before the World Cup; they implied that a World Cup tournament in South Africa was bound to end in crime and murder, that the South Africans were incapable of organizing such an event. But South Africa was a wonderful host and changed the world's view both of that country and of the entire African continent, as I heard recently from Africans themselves at the African Union summit. Major events like these are guaranteed to affect us here: not just because of the sport, but also because they present huge opportunities, for investment for example-from the construction of stadiums to tourism marketing./////At global level German foreign policy is committed to fair framework conditions. We need global institutions which are universally accepted and capable of action. This is true of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as the World Trade Organization. We are approaching the necessary reforms resolutely. On international trade policy in particular, we must throw our entire weight onto the scale to ward off dangers to the world economy from a renewed bout of protectionism. Only free and open markets lead to development and growth. It is very gratifying that the Federal Economics Minister has put this right at the top of his agenda./////I am saying this not least with an eye to a country which is rightly taking up all our attention just now. As we are all aware, the floods in Pakistan in recent weeks have caused unimaginable damage and suffering. We Germans acted quickly to provide effective aid. When I say ""we Germans"", I mean not only the Government and state institutions, but also our citizens, something which is never highly enough appreciated. It means a great deal for our image in the world when our citizens respond so actively and so caringly in such situations. But what happens afterwards? After this immediate humanitarian aid, it is a question of what we can do for a country like Pakistan so that it remains stable, so that it doesn't crumple, collapse in economic terms. Here, again, foreign policy and economic policy need to work together, for example in an initiative I have just launched in Europe to open up channels for trade for products from Pakistan. A not uncontroversial move, as you all know, but presumably more sustainable than the help needed now in the short term but which naturally cannot be viable in the long term./////In this connection the Federal Economics Ministry and the Federal Foreign Office are pulling in the same direction. Rainer Brderle and I have been in complete agreement on this for many years. You'll have realized that we didn't just meet each other for the first time in the Cabinet./////We want to make use of new opportunities for Germany across the world. But we will not be losing sight of our partners right here on our doorstep. And this brings me to the last thought I'd like to share./////Of course we export a lot to East Asian countries and everyone is talking about China and the domestic changes it will have to undergo so that it can be even more important and attractive for us in economic terms. But-and maybe I'll surprise some of you now-Germany still exports more to the Netherlands than it does to China. So I'll just say one thing: we must value Europe. Not merely in economic terms, but especially as the major project for peace, freedom and prosperity on our continent. I say this because Europe is very often spoken of carelessly: Rainer Brderle, other colleagues and I could all tell tales about that. Of course it is unbelievably tiring sometimes to discuss things for hours, sometimes through the night, and to negotiate with countries where you wonder why they're vetoing things and what their interest could be in doing so. Of course it is strenuous to negotiate through the night, but the fact that the European cooperative model replaced the confrontation model that previously existed on our continent is a tremendous historic achievement by those who held positions of responsibility before us. It's better to negotiate through the night than to be at odds with countries on your own continent. Just over ten years ago we still had wars in Europe. Even if Europe had achieved nothing more than several decades of peace on our continent, it would still have been worthwhile./////This, to my mind, is more important than the issue of a single market with almost five hundred million people and the opportunities inherent in the single currency. But I would also say that European integration, the single market and single currency were success stories for Germany in particular, and especially for the German economy. That is why we must work together to promote this European ideal. Europe will only be strong if it is firmly supported by the people of Europe-and ensuring that this is the case is not a matter for policymakers alone./////Reliability must be the trademark of European economic and financial policy too. This means rigorous rules for swift debt reduction and on new borrowing. And these rules must actually be enforced. Anyone who ignores the joint responsibility, persists in reporting false figures, manipulates statistics, becomes overindebted, does not budget in a sound, serious manner, cannot simply get away with it in Europe. This applies to both small and large countries. This applies to others and also to us. The Stability and Growth Pact needs an automatic sanctions regime so that whenever anyone violates the joint responsibility it will have immediate consequences. I am firmly convinced of this and negotiations must take place on this now. It is in the interests of all euro states committed to a healthy euro, and anyone not sticking to the rules must not be allowed to get any more money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to all, no matter how big or powerful a country might be in Europe. We want a European Union of responsibility and we are enthusiastic Europeans, but what we don't want is a transfer union in Europe where basically everyone can behave irresponsibly without repercussions. That is not on. Anyone wishing to protect Europe will have to change the rules on this./////You all know that foreign and domestic policy are becoming ever more closely interlinked. You see this in the climate debate and also, for instance, in what we discussed yesterday with the Foreign Minister of Mexico./////I am delighted at and congratulate the Federal Economics Minister on the successful negotiations on energy policy and of course on the fact that a rational energy mix has been agreed. This is also of great significance for foreign policy, and here I come to the close. It is of course true that we discuss energy policy from the point of view of environmental protection and climate change, subjects we will shortly be considering in Cancun in Mexico. But energy policy is more than just a question of ecology, economics or the affordability of energy; rather, it is also a question of our foreign-policy sovereignty. If we make ourselves too dependent on one energy supplier, we are making ourselves not only economically dependent but also politically impressionable. And that is something we must always bear in mind. If we want to retain our sovereignty in foreign policy, then we have to acknowledge that our economy is best based on an energy mix. Hence the decisions of yesterday and the day before. I believe this to be right; energy policy, more than virtually any other field, shows just how interlinked foreign policy and economic policy really are./////Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to hearing what the Federal Economics Minister has to say to us.//////////",0.2
International trade,    21.10.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Guido Westerwelle, Member of the Bundestag and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairsat the German Council on Foreign Relations Berlin, 21 October 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__ translation of advanced text__/////Mr von Maltzahn,Excellencies,Members of the Bundestag,Ladies and gentlemen,/////A few days ago, Germany was voted on to the UN Security Council. The vote took place only a few days after we celebrated the 20th anniversary of German unity. Both events can be regarded as a mark of the trust placed in Germany./////The election to the Security Council a few days ago and unification 20 years ago were both a sign of confidence and a gesture of faith in Germany./////In the preamble, the authors of the Basic Law mapped out a clear course for German foreign policy: ""to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united Europe"". This guiding principle enabled us to gain the confidence which made unity possible. To this very day, our country's course is determined by this guiding principle./////German foreign policy has been marked by continuity during the last few decades. It is reliable and calculable. It is guided by our values and interests. And it is an engine for political opening and economic development. German foreign policy is geared to equal partnership and a fair give-and-take./////However, German foreign policy is not static. It always reflects the world around us. The global balance is shifting rapidly. Today our largest export markets are France, the US, Britain and the Netherlands. As early as next year, China could move up to second place./////Emerging powers such as China, India and Brazil are becoming heavyweights not just economically and politically but also socially and culturally./////Our relations with these states are not just about trade and investment but also about our country's vitality and competitiveness. That is precisely why domestic and foreign policy are ever more closely interlinked. As Foreign Minister, I'd like to inject some of the dynamism of these emerging societies into our own debate. Foreign policy is of growing importance in the age of globalization./////I wish that a country like Germany could expand its global presence in order to intensify political dialogue and external economic promotion. I wish we had more money for more scholarship holders from around the world, that we could fund even more schools where German is taught and learned./////But not everything we wish for is possible. Budget consolidation is painful but unavoidable. It also means cuts in the Foreign Service. But Germany's voice will only carry weight in the world if it gets its public finances in order and keeps its economy on a growth course. New growth, not new debts, opens up new scope for action. Only an economically strong country capable of reforming can have real influence in the world in the long run./////For influence abroad is contingent upon strength at home. The ability to carry out domestic reforms and a society which places great value on education and innovation strengthen a country's ability to exert influence in the foreign policy field./////This gives rise to three key guiding principles. Firstly, German foreign policy is aimed at strengthening Europe as a model for cooperation and integration./////Secondly, German foreign policy is, in the broadest sense, committed to peace, security and stability and promotes disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation./////Thirdly, German foreign policy is geared to seizing the opportunities offered by globalization for the benefit of all. During the last twelve months, we've mapped out the way ahead in each of these three spheres./////The European Union is the foundation on which German foreign policy rests. It is our guarantor of peace, freedom, security and justice. The EU is the insurance policy that keeps us prosperous. Germany will only be heard in tomorrow's world if we act together with our European partners in the Union. Germany remains the engine of integration./////At the beginning of the year, Europe found itself on the edge of an abyss. Another crisis like the one in Greece this spring would severely test the Union. Another crisis could destroy decades of clear-sighted policies./////After such a fundamental challenge there's no question of us carrying on as before. We need a European answer to a European crisis. This is the right time. We have to learn the right lessons now./////That's why it's so important that we take vigorous action now and negotiate with determination in the interest of Europe's internal cohesion. Excessive deficit procedures against member states in the eurozone have been instigated 22 times during the last few years. Not once have sanctions been imposed. We know from our own painful experience that simply commencing the procedure doesn't make member states change course. We don't have to point the finger at Greece, for we Germans played a role in the watering down of the Stability Pact in 2004/2005./////The claim that Germany procrastinated and hesitated for too long during the Greece crisis this spring is wrong. Through our perseverance, we achieved much more than a mere voluntary undertaking on the part of Greece to implement tough consolidation measures. We brought about a turnaround towards a European consolidation and stability policy unprecedented in our continent's history./////Our task now is to make this stability culture binding. First of all, we need a sanctions mechanism which is above political opportunism. It makes a big practical difference if sanctions are passed by a two-thirds majority, or can only be blocked by a two-thirds majority. Secondly, we need an amendment to the EU Treaties in order to create a robust mechanism for those countries which can't or won't resolve their difficulties. Such a mechanism must involve private investors. That's what we aim to achieve during the negotiations at the European Council next week. That's Europe's challenge for the coming year./////I would caution against the renationalization of policies./////Germany will not countenance such a course. Those who respond to the euro crisis by calling into question the European idea have learned nothing from history. Germany unequivocally stands behind Europe, the European Union and a hard euro. Renationalization would be a mistake./////The secret of the success of European integration is the table in Brussels at which all EU states sit as equal partners with the same rights, irrespective of their size. Everyone has one vote at this table, and everyone is heard. The Union isn't divided into important and unimportant states. Anyone who wants to make decisions without consulting other EU partners would damage the European idea and, ultimately, themselves. We were only able to overcome centuries of confrontation by cooperating and by regarding each other as equals./////Each and every country must respect all others./////In the enlarged EU, we have to take special care to cultivate our partnerships. That's why it was important to me to visit all our partners during my first year in office./////Germany is committed to a more efficient Union. We want to use the Lisbon Treaty to this end. In the debate about the European External Action Service, we have always stood by the High Representative so that the EU gains a functioning instrument. Minister of State Werner Hoyer has made a considerable contribution towards this. A fully coordinated European foreign policy is only possible if the EEAS is strong. We've created the institutions and now we have to work on the substance./////The key achievement of the post-war generation is reconciliation with our neighbours and Germany's integration into the West./////Today, we have to focus on ensuring that Europe also integrates with the East. I'd like to see relations with Poland reaching the level achieved between Germans and the French over the last few decades. We still have a long way to go. From day one, I've been careful not to do anything which could stand in the way of reconciliation and close friendship. That's why my very first trip as Foreign Minister took me to Warsaw. That's why we've again made the Weimar Triangle a driving force for Europe. This format is to take Europe forward at President and Head of Government level in 2011. That's why I'll decide together with my Polish counterpart in the coming weeks how we want to mark the 20th anniversary of our Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness and support the forthcoming Polish EU Presidency. Minister of State Cornelia Pieper is working tirelessly on this issue./////Our common goal with Poland is a strong partnership with our neighbours east of the European Union./////We want to support their efforts to modernize, thus creating a common area of prosperity, rule of law, security and freedom. Together with Poland, we want to provide the EU's Eastern Partnership with fresh impetus./////Russia is a strategic partner. That doesn't mean overlooking or ignoring shortcomings in Russia's society or mode of governance. Regarding Russia as a partner is the best way to resolve problems. Germany's policy on Russia hasn't been reinvented in the course of the last year. However, it has been integrated into an overall European approach. Today more than ever, the old and persistent suspicion that Germany was implementing its policy on Russia without consulting our immediate neighbours and other partners has been allayed./////Our partners in Europe have made the German concept of a modernization agenda their own. Russia has been more closely integrated into the European security policy and the Eastern Partnership. We are currently developing new initiatives to foster closer cooperation with a view to strengthening the rule of law. The trilateral cooperation between Germany, Poland and Russia was an effective instrument for better integrating our policy on Russia./////Even though we are focusing this year in Europe on crisis management, the EU remains a successful model with great appeal. We should use this potential wisely. If we hastily slam the door in Turkey's face then we'll squander a historic opportunity. For me, it's quite clear that in our dealings with Turkey: ""pacta sunt servanda"". We'll keep our word. We'll honour our pledges. We're therefore doing everything in our power to ensure that the negotiations are conducted honestly as an open-ended process, and that they don't lead into a dead end. I've assured my Turkish partners of this. I've advocated this course of action during the last two EU Presidencies. At the same time, we can't reduce Turkey's role to individual chapters of the negotiations. We're talking about a proud, dynamic and important country whose pro European orientation is vital to us and which is gaining in power and influence in the region. The Federal President demonstrated this in a very convincing way during his state visit./////Europe works when it stands together. This autumn Serbia was faced with the choice of whether to move towards Europe or use the United Nations as a platform for a policy of conflict with Kosovo. Serbia wisely chose Europe. Making this happen was not the work of just Lady Ashton, William Hague or myself. Our united and unequivocal message paid off. Unity makes us strong. We've thus demonstrated that Europe's model of cooperation functions internally and is effective in the wider world. Serbia kept its word./////That's why it's so important that Europe keeps its word. I'll press for a unanimous decision on Monday to refer Serbia's EU accession application to the European Commission./////German foreign policy is peace policy because it's geared in the broadest sense towards greater security. German security interests are tied in with the European Union as well as the transatlantic alliance with the US./////Disarmament is finally recognized once more as an international issue of relevance to the future. I'm pleased how much momentum has been created over the last few months in the debate about disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation./////The nuclear threat has increased rather than decreased since the end of the Cold War. Today we have more states with nuclear weapons. We have groups and organizations which want nothing more than to gain access to weapons of mass destruction. Non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control are therefore not an issue of the past, but rather a challenge for humanity today. We're working to ensure that weapons of mass destruction do not become the bane of globalization./////The German Government is therefore pursuing the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. To this end we support the strategic disarmament efforts of the US and Russia. We welcome the fact that for the first time the US Administration has stated the diminished importance of these weapons in its new nuclear doctrine./////I firmly believe that the withdrawal of the last tactical nuclear weapons from Germany remains a catalyst for achieving a much broader result. Substrategic nuclear weapons should be part of the overall disarmament efforts. They aren't separate from the issue of conventional disarmament and we're striving to bring about their withdrawal in cooperation with our allies. Germany will not act alone in this issue./////I'm confident we'll adopt a new Strategic Concept at the NATO summit in Lisbon this November which attaches a degree of importance to disarmament and arms control unparalleled since the 1967 Harmel Report. After many intensive talks with the NATO Secretary General, who will be our guest in Berlin tomorrow, I know that he shares this view. I'll then be able to inform him officially that we're pleased to be hosting the Informal Meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers here in Berlin next April./////In spring our efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime were successful and at the Review Conference in New York we continued to work to ensure that this key instrument is implemented. We want to extend the IAEA's monitoring rights. Our unity of purpose also bore fruit in the nuclear conflict with Iran. Who would have thought a year ago that all of the permanent members of the Security Council, including China and Russia, would demand full transparency from Tehran? They did. That sent a powerful message. During the E3+3 talks, Germany played its part in the formulation of European sanctions. The aim of these sanctions was, is and remains to bring Iran to the negotiating table. Iran has now agreed to resume negotiations in November. I have no illusions that results can be achieved quickly, but I do believe this is an opportunity to move forward. There's no alternative to negotiations./////In New York last month a group of states led by Japan and Australia joined forces in order to bring new momentum to global disarmament and arms control. We will meet again in six months in Berlin, at my invitation. Germany is playing a leading role in this group, for German foreign policy is disarmament policy./////Disarmament is gaining momentum. The talks on conventional arms control in Vienna, on an adapted CFE Treaty, are finally picking up speed once again. I hope that the US Congress will ratify the New START Treaty very soon. We are campaigning to ensure that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is not shelved indefinitely. We are firmly convinced that the new Strategic Concept should mark the start of a follow up process./////The NATO Summit in Lisbon in a few weeks' time will show how close we and our American friends stand. But-on this I agree with my US counterpart Hillary Clinton-the transatlantic partnership alone is no longer enough. The alliance with the US does however remain our backbone, because nobody can contribute to peace and development around the world better than this transatlantic partnership./////The current discussion between Americans and Europeans on missile defence is a great improvement on the debate we had not long ago. At that stage, the talk was of bilateral projects between Washington and Prague, and Washington and Warsaw, which would have created zones of differing security in Europe. Now we are talking about joint solutions which have as their goal our common security in Europe, and which bring Russia on board. This is not just a great leap forward, but also a real chance to put relations with Russia on a totally new footing./////It is remarkable that President Medvedev has announced his attendance at the forthcoming NATO Summit. People everywhere are realizing that lasting security and stability in Europe can only be achieved with Russian involvement./////Throughout history, strong neighbours have always been potential threats. But today, it is weak, distant countries that are a challenge to our security. In our globalized world, failing and failed states and regional conflicts can have a direct and detrimental effect on our security. Crisis management far from our borders has become an almost daily contribution to security within our borders./////The stability of West Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan is crucial to our security. We have put our operations in Afghanistan on a new foundation. We have drawn sober, honest conclusions and defined realistic goals. We have closely coordinated this new strategy with our allies in London and Kabul, and above all with the Afghans themselves./////The situation in Afghanistan is difficult and demands the utmost from our soldiers, police officers, diplomats and reconstruction workers. But alongside all the problems, there is some good news. For the first time, we now have a strategy that clearly and unambiguously has the goal of transferring responsibility to the Afghans. This will have been completed by 2014. We are doing more for training and more for reconstruction. And we are actively promoting social reconciliation. We will not solve the problems by military means alone. A political solution is the key. The NATO Summit in Lisbon will ring in a new phase of transferring responsibility, which will start next year./////Germany and Europe are also called upon to do more for Pakistan's stability. Afghanistan will not become stable until the region surrounding the border, i.e. also in Pakistan, has been pacified. A prospering and democratic Pakistan is the key for stability and security in the whole region. At the Friends of Pakistan meeting in Brussels last week we however also made clear that the country cannot rely on international aid alone, but must also make its own contribution./////I will soon set off on my third visit to the Middle East. We should not delude ourselves that we have the key to a peaceful solution in our hands. But we want to do all we can to foster and strengthen the fragile process towards a two-state solution. Germany feels a responsibility to play its part. We hold Israel's security to be non-negotiable. At the same time, with the first meeting of the German-Palestinian Steering Committee this spring, we helped the Palestinians prepare for the responsibilities of statehood./////Germany is also playing an active role with respect to other regional conflicts, such as those in Yemen and Somalia. The planned but difficult referendum in the Sudan in January 2011 could be among the first challenges we face on the UN Security Council./////Nobody should mistake our dogged attempts to settle conflicts peacefully for a lack of realism. Our ability to stabilize failed or failing states is limited. There are no patent remedies, as the West has had to learn-sometimes painfully. We can play a supporting role. The more we take account of cultural and historical realities, the greater our chances of success. The most important prerequisite for ending violence remains the yearning for peace and readiness for reconciliation of the people themselves. Germany will continue to advocate a culture of restraint with regard to the use of military force. It is always a weapon of last resort./////Globalization is shaping our world. Our interconnected Germany is a living part of globalization; we live from globalization. Good foreign policy must therefore advocate openness. What is new is not international trade and exchange as such, but the dramatic speed at which changes occur. Nations used to rise and fall over the centuries. Now a few decades is all it takes./////We want to help shape globalization because it will have an impact on our prosperity, our society and our freedom. We therefore want to seize the tremendous opportunities that globalization brings, whilst at the same time subjecting it to a framework of rules./////Globalization has brought cross-cutting issues such as energy and the climate, natural resources, water and food, health and demographics, to the fore. Politics, business and academia are called upon to forge partnerships to find joint solutions. Conflicts in these fields are also increasingly becoming an issue for traditional foreign and security policy. To impose order on a confusing, multi-dimensional world we also need new partners./////Latin America remains an underestimated continent. We have systematically enhanced our relations with the countries of South America, Central America and the Caribbean. Our engagement for and in Africa, whose new self-confidence was tangible at the African Union Summit in Kampala, and our cooperation with partners such as Turkey, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia are all part of our strategy. We are doing more to embed emerging countries in international structures. Ownership and responsibility go together, both are part of globalization./////The new partners are visible as part of the G20. We want the G20 to integrate its work better with that of the United Nations. Germany has a considerable interest in the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and thus in their willingness to undergo internal reform. The globalized world and Germany's interests call for both flexibility, on the one hand, to bring on board new partners and, on the other, for retaining tried and tested internationally legitimized institutions. Both ways forward must be effective. The greatest legitimacy remains with the United Nations, which makes it irreplaceable./////During my visit to India earlier this week I saw how a strong civil society and a young elite with a thirst for education can drive the development of their country. And in China, we can see each day how a new world power is striving to find the right balance between its own interests and the correct posture to adapt to the outside world. We are doing what we can to help, for example through our dialogue on human rights./////We want Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo to be able to accept his award in person, at liberty. He embodies values that we embrace wholeheartedly. China can be proud of its prize-winner./////China and India are becoming ever more important. But we are witnessing today not just the rise of individual countries. We are witnessing an increasing interconnectivity across all of Asia. That's why I'm pleased when the ASEAN states want to know more about European integration. That's why I'm pleased that we Europeans have concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea./////Three days ago, it was brought home to me by Indian students that knowledge is the decisive resource in today's world. Education is the social issue of the age of globalization. In the long term, competition between education systems is the most decisive factor in determining whether nations progress or regress. This is the key to globalization, for good education can be provided nearly everywhere./////Values and interests belong together. This is true for education as for almost no other field. We are working to export the German dual system of vocational training, which combines apprenticeships with classroom lessons, since this also enhances the attractiveness of Germany as a technological location. We are promoting the teaching of the German language and joint research in future-related fields such as nanotechnology, energy efficiency and electromobility, since both language and research build bridges for the exchange of knowledge and thus also for the exchange of views and attitudes. Social mobility through education is made a joint experience. Students and researchers from abroad gain direct experience of our society, in which the equality of the sexes is a reality, through joint study and research. The spending of around a quarter of the Federal Foreign Office's budget on cultural relations and education policy, language promotion and research and academic relations policy, contributes to globalizing our values./////Our human rights policy also uses the opportunities created by educational cooperation and economic relations. I take this as another example of the fact that promoting values and asserting interests are two sides of the same coin./////Promoting German economic interests on the world markets is an objective of German foreign policy. This objective is by no means motivated solely by money. Trade plays a significant role in the globalization of our values. Prosperity and integration create middle classes. Middle classes want civil rights, an independent judiciary, transparent and efficient authorities, less corruption and more political responsibility, all of which correspond to our values. A world in which hundreds of millions can rise to join the middle classes is a better world. People who can take their future into their own hands will demand and fight for a better society./////These people are our allies. These people appreciate it when we speak out clearly for human rights in our dealings with their governments. It is sometimes said that one has to choose between standing up for human rights and maintaining good relations with governments. That is not my experience. One does not earn respect by taking such ""sensitivities"" into account, one changes nothing by stepping too softly./////Many states want to share in globalization. But this desire is first and foremost one shared by billions of people. Individual freedom is the ideal route to participation. There can only be losers in a clash of civilizations. But everyone wins in the competition for the best ideas./////The best ideas include inventions. What we export most successfully are new technologies. For this reason the Federal Government supports innovative projects in the fields of climate, infrastructure, water and resources. As part of an intelligent foreign commodities policy we are promoting international renewable energy projects such as DESERTEC./////It is neither egoism nor altruism that makes German foreign policy stake its claim to shape the globalized world, but because we are part of it, a highly interconnected part of it. Only political action to give globalization a human face can prevent us, too, from being threatened by globalization's dark side. Strengthening international law, be it by combating climate change or by prosecuting crimes against humanity, plays a key role in such action./////Interests and values are inseparable for German foreign policy. Humanity and compassion are values that make no distinction on the basis of skin colour or religious beliefs. I would like to thank all the Germans who gave generously of their time and money following the earthquake in Haiti, and more recently, when the Indus burst its banks bringing devastation to large parts of Pakistan. Foreign policy is not just about government action. Our image abroad is equally shaped by the generosity and readiness of our citizens to help./////An interconnected world does not need arbitrary values, what it needs is constructive multilateralism. If multiculturalism means giving up our standards and values, it is clearly a wrong turn. If multiculturalism means that diversity and cross-fertilization are more than ever a part of all our lives, at home and internationally, then ""multikulti"" is a reality./////German foreign policy stands for a stabilizing, rule-based world order. A world of shared norms and cooperation in a spirit of partnership is the best basis for peace and development. With this in mind, Germany stood for election to the Security Council. The world's vote was a sign of confidence-the same confidence that made German unification possible 20 years ago-but also a call for us to prove ourselves./////We will put our backs into the two years of work that now await us. We will collaborate in efforts to make the Security Council itself reflect the realities of our times. We therefore want Latin America and Africa to be permanently represented on the Security Council and do not want Asia to remain underrepresented. Germany is also willing itself to assume responsibility on the Security Council on a permanent basis. Our long-term goal remains a permanent seat for the European Union./////We will bring our experience, our capabilities and our proposals to bear in the Security Council. We will not preach, but we do not have any cause to hide. Thank you for your attention.//////////",0.1
International trade,    21.06.2010 - Speech,Opening speech by Minister of State Hoyer at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum 'Climate Change and the Media' - Federal Foreign Office ,dialogue,"__ check against delivery! __/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////We are gathered in a historical place today for the third Global Media Forum hosted by Deutsche Welle titled ""The Heat is on-Climate Change and the Media"". The plenary chamber of the former German Bundestag is located on the grounds where Germany found its way back to its democratic roots after 1945. For decades, this is where decisions that guided and shaped Germany were made./////This is where Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl presented his ten point plan in 1989, thereby laying the foundation for German unification. Just a year later, on the very day of unification, Federal President Richard von Weizsäcker made the following statement that many of us will always remember: ""We hope to serve world peace in a united Europe.""/////This statement is more relevant today than ever before. For the world has not become a more peaceful place. New challenges threaten our security. These challenges are usually global in nature and we can only address them together, globally. This is especially true when it comes to climate change, a phenomenon that affects all of us. Around the world. Though the effects vary greatly./////In order to effectively counter climate change, we have to look beyond the borders of our country and take an interdisciplinary approach. That is why I am particularly glad that Deutsche Welle, in cooperation with the Federal Foreign Office, has brought together media representatives from around the world, experts from international organizations and govern­ment agencies, as well as politicians, artists, entrepreneurs and academics for this year's Global Media Forum./////Deutsche Welle has recognized that a topic like climate change requires networked thinking on a global level. As the seat of the UNFCCC secretariat, Bonn is the ideal place for doing this. We want to promote and further develop Bonn as a UN location. This is an expression of our international engagement. We have to work together to fight climate change and create a spirit of solidarity, as we have in other fields./////Though the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit was unsatisfactory, closer interna­tional cooperation is the only viable course. If we continue to work together-I'm already looking ahead to the next climate summit at the end of the year in Cancun-we can succeed in finding common solutions. On climate issues, there is no alternative to the UN process./////Over the next few days you will focus on climate change and the media. If you think about it, climate change has everything a story needs to make headlines around the world-everyone has heard of it and has an opinion on it. It is discussed extensively and emotionally, it directly influences many people's lives and can further escalate existing conflicts or even cause new ones. If it were a celebrity, climate change would have no problem keeping fans on their toes. Yet despite the relevance and urgency of climate change, it is a topic that inspires the same feeling among all media consumers and journalists: we hear about this all the time, we've done countless stories on this. Does this topic offer us anything that is new or newsworthy?/////In a media world where competition for high circulation and the best ratings is becoming increasingly tough, climate change will encounter ever greater difficulties finding its way into newspapers, news magazines and talk shows. On the one hand it is a topic of only latent rele­vance, but on the other hand its problems are becoming ever more pressing./////Extreme weather, crop failure and famine-changes in the climate already portend disastrous consequences for millions of people around the world. North and south will be equally affected, yet particularly the world's island states. For some countries this threat is already tangible. Their very existence is in acute danger, and with it an important human right: the right to live in a healthy environment./////These countries are rightly counting on assistance from the international community. To simply accept or ignore this situation is not an option for us! Globalization also means a global, universal neighbourhood. Events in other regions of the world affect us more directly today than ever before. There are no longer any remote areas or incidents. The fight against climate change is therefore one of the central issues of the 21st century./////Climate change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and social development of every continent and its nations. It can cause instability in states and regions and be harmful to the peaceful coexistence of different populations. That is why climate protection is not just a topic for specialists. Climate issues, or to put it more precisely, international climate issues are an important part of our foreign policy which is aimed at achieving and maintaining peace and security./////German climate policy has brought new ideas to the international arena. The Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which was held at the beginning of May, is one example. Together with Mexico, Germany invited around 50 environment ministers from all around the world to the Petersberg near Bonn. This intentionally informal conference achieved its goal: it strengthened the trust between negotiating partners that had been weakened in light of the disappointing results of the Copenhagen summit. This trust is essential to achieving substantial progress in the negotiations on a UN climate agreement./////The Petersberg Climate Dialogue also inspired new international initiatives. For example in rainforest protection, where Germany is making considerable financial resources available, or on international standards for reviewing and assessing climate protection measures. Here Germany, along with South Africa and South Korea, is willing to serve as a coordinator. Through its multi-faceted engagement, Germany shows that it is assuming responsibility for climate change./////In Central Asia, the Federal Foreign Office is making 22.5 million euro available to improve the water supply. Water is scarce and unevenly distributed in this region. The largely dried-up Aral Sea, once the fourth-largest lake in the world, is a dramatic symbol of this water shortage. Within the framework of the so-called Berlin Process, the Federal Foreign Office is now supporting the establishment of sustainable structures for cross-border water management. Networking is taking place among water experts from Germany, the EU and Central Asia and education opportunities in the field of water management are being created./////Since 2009 the German Government has provided concrete support for countries threatened by climate change through the International Climate Initiative, to which we devote 120 million euro annually. While other countries are still considering whether or not to provide financial assistance, we are already implementing it-with an innovative aid instru­ment that has received much international praise./////Because what's special about the International Climate Initiative is the way it is financed. The funds come directly from the returns on auctioning allowances within the EU's emissions trading system. In Germany, we put a price on greenhouse gas emissions that the polluter has to pay. And we use this financial compensation for climate protection./////Our country is known around the world for its environmentally-friendly technology and ideas and we are working to establish sustainable economic structures that reflect ecological as well as economic goals. Here Germany is an international leader. We are promoting renewable energy in Germany-this is guaranteed by law-and have made environmental protection a national goal that is firmly rooted in our constitution, the Basic Law./////The German Govern­ment has voluntarily committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2020. This is a goal that sends an international message, a goal that puts us at the forefront internationally, as well as within the EU./////German companies are also making a sustainable contribution to reviving the global economy that was weakened by the financial and economic crisis by investing in innovative technologies./////A stable climate along with sustainable, reliable and affordable energy are essential to the world's economies. A joint initiative aimed at investing in new, cleaner energy sources could create jobs, conserve the environment and protect the climate, improve living standards and increase global security./////All around the world initiatives and alliances aimed at curbing climate change have emerged. At the bilateral level as well, we are seeing increasingly intensive cooperation./////One example is the Transatlantic Climate Bridge, which since September 2008 has represented strengthened cooperation between Germany and the United States. Different projects bring together Germans and Americans who are working for climate protection. From journalists and farmers to businesses and universities, all participants are given a valuable opportunity to share their experience./////Making these developments visible to the broader public requires free and independent media. Reporting on climate change is a major challenge for journalists. On the one hand, the material is often highly scientific, complicated and controversial. On the other hand, it is often impossible to see the results of climate protection projects in the short term. Journalists have to ask themselves: which aspects of this topic are new and interesting? How can they be presented without resorting to cliches? And how can often abstract developments be explained in an accessible way?/////Here the media have a major responsibility. They can directly influence people's behaviour. For that reason, it is important that it is not just the spectacular natural disasters that make the news. Instead reporting needs to go deeper to shed light on the background and explain approaches to solving these problems. In this way, the media can help create transparency and make the political and scientific processes more accessible./////This requires media representatives around the world to have extensive background knowledge, creativity and commitment. That is why, above all, training for journalists is becoming more and more important. Even though many of them would like to bring this topic more into the spotlight, they often don't know how. This is where Deutsche Welle's training for international journalists, which receives financial support from the Federal Foreign Office, comes in./////Deutsche Welle's ""Akademie"" equips media representatives in many developing countries and emerging economies with the journalistic and technical skills to professionally portray political, cultural or economic topics. Bringing journalists from all over Central Asia together for a seminar on how to improve their online and radio programmes, for instance, or teaching radio editors from Guinea-Bissau how to produce accessible, understandable educational programmes is a step towards strengthening media around the world, thus making them more independent. Because media representatives who feel confident in their trade are better able to resist external intervention and influences. Moreover, audiences take them seriously and listen to them./////It is also necessary to mention the enormous potential social networks hold in this context. Social networks are an effective way to link people around the world-a decisive factor when dealing with a global topic like climate change. For young people in particular, the internet is increasingly becoming the main means of communication-in Germany alone, young people spend an average of over 100 minutes a day online./////As part of the social web, media have the opportunity to use existing structures to initiate discussions, gather ideas from their target audiences and effectively position their topics. Due to the constantly growing number of interactive opportunities, this field is becoming more and more interesting for the media./////And the media are already utilizing this potential. Evidence of this can also be seen on the Global Media Forum website. Conference participants can network with one another online, discuss the topic and stay in touch. Users can submit photos for an interactive world map that demon­strates climate change where they live./////I would like to invite all of you to actively participate in the virtual discussion-may today's conference be the start!/////This year's Global Media Forum would like to draw attention to the urgency of climate prob­lems and develop approaches to solving them. Only when experts from different fields come together, as they have here, can we develop and implement responses./////That is why the Federal Foreign Office is once again happy to support this conference, as it has in past years. I hope you will meet many interesting new people and have intensive discussions over the next three days. I am sure that together we will find ways to solidly establish climate change as a topic in the media./////Climate change has the potential to make headlines-even without the disasters!/////",0.3
International trade,    26.11.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle at the fourth Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe 2010 in Hamburg on 26 November 2010 - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ translation of advanve text __//////////General Secretary Ma,/////Commissioner Almunia,/////Mayor Ahlhaus,/////Excellencies,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce and the China Federation of Industrial Economics for their invitation and for organizing this important conference./////The Chinese and German economies are doing well. This year, China is set to grow by nearly ten percent. Even during the crisis, Chinese growth was robust./////This growth has now also reached the rural parts of the country, allowing more and more people in China to enjoy the benefits. We appreciate very much that China has lifted millions out of poverty./////As a major exporter, Germany has also benefited from China's growth. Our exports to China were even growing in the years of the crisis./////This year, we expect the German economy to grow by 3.4 percent. Unlike in previous years, this growth is due not only to our strong exports but also to increasing domestic demand. The German Government attaches great importance to encouraging this development. Our country is doing better today than it was a year ago./////This is not just good news for the people of Germany. In closely interconnected national economies we each benefit from the other's growth./////We have a volume of bilateral trade of more than 90 billion euro. Germany is China's most important trading partner in the EU. And China is Germany's most important trading partner in Asia./////China and Germany, two export nations, depend particularly on networks, open markets and free trade. This is particularly true when it comes to raw materials. Last month, the federal government adopted a new raw materials strategy. We will work for a fair and sustainable use of these materials. In a globalized world with its international division of labour, free trade in raw materials is a great asset. Access to raw materials should be made fair and reliable. China would act in its own economic interests if China reconsidered its decisions on export restrictions./////China and Germany share an interest in a fair and stable system of world trade, and we should continue to work on that together./////The world economy benefits from open markets, in Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere./////That is why I strongly support all efforts to conclude free trade agreements beetween the EU and partners in Asia. We need strong exchange between strong partners. Large long-term current-account imbalances ought to be redressed as well as possible. I believe we all agree on this. However, we cannot focus on only one indicator. Competitiveness must not be penalized, but encouraged./////China and Germany are connected by a strategic partnership. In 2011, our governments will hold our first comprehensive consultations. For all our differences, we cooperate in many ways, to our mutual benefit./////More cooperation should also be the basis of the EU's new strategy towards China. I will continue my efforts to help shaping the relationship between China and the EU./////Today, China's rise has an impact on almost all of Europe's global interests./////Preserving our prosperity, free world trade, climate protection, the universality of human rights, security interests in Africa and the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Iran./////Given its size, its economic and political standing, China is a key partner for the EU in the 21st century./////As China's importance in the international community grows, the country's responsibility for international security grows as well./////Only a year ago but a few would have expected the international community to agree on a common position on Iran. But we have succeeded. Thanks to the circumspection shown by those involved. Through consultations we were able to agree with Russia and China on a common position in the security council./////The international community cannot accept Iran holding nuclear weapons. We welcome the Chinese contribution towards this unified position./////We need China as an actor for global peace. This is especially true with regard to the dangerous provocation by North Korea. We are very concerned about the recent incidents on the South Korean island. We strongly condemn the North-Korean attacks on the island of Yeonpyeong. We asked China to use its influence to contribute to a de-escalation of the situation./////As an economic heavyweight, China shares responsibility to the global economy as a whole. We therefore welcome the fact that China will assume an even more important role in the International Monetary Fund following IMF reform./////China is an active member of the G20. The country is in close contact with the G8. The exchange rates between the world currencies are just one of the issues which we debate in these groups./////Iwelcome that China is allowing a gradual appreciation of its currency. We encourage China to take further steps in the same direction. It is in the interests of both the country itself and its partners in trade that the exchange rate properly reflects the strength of a country's economy./////China and the European Union are closely linked by direct investment. Chinese investors are very welcome in the European Union, as they are in Germany. We know what they contribute to economic growth and the protection of jobs here. In this great harbour city of Hamburg this can be witnessed every day./////Iwelcome very much Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's tribute to European companies doing business in the country. He said that foreign enterprises registered in China are Chinese enterprises. It is important that EU enterprises making products and paying taxes in China receive the same legal treatment as Chinese companies./////Chinese companies enjoy equal treatment in the EU. We needs to same the for EU companies, whether in awarding public contracts, in labour law or any other area./////We acknowledge China's progress in the protection of intellectual property./////Many innovative Chinese companies have accumulated intellectual property very much worth protecting. I am convinced that this protection is essential for a creative and innovative environment./////The rule of law and the right to take legal action are very important for foreign investment. China has undertaken great efforts in the last several years to reform its legal system. The rule of law is the basis of political reform, which your Government has recognized as essential. I wish you courage and strength when you continue on this path./////The German Government supports China in this process through our intensive rule of law dialogue. Together with our human rights dialogue, this builds a solid foundation for a real partnership. Values and interests are not opposites, we need them both as pillars of our foreign policy./////When it comes to the big global issues, China and the European Union should work closely together. You all know the challenges involved and have been discussing them in great depth over the last few days./////No one denies any longer that climate change affects us all. Climate policy is a task for the entire international community. In the long term, we want to set targets that are binding under international law. The European Union is all set to work with China on this constructive cooperation. My recent talks with the Chinese foreign minister confirmed that the Chinese government wants to tackle climate change as a matter of urgency./////Together, we need to make progress at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun./////Climate protection is compatible with economic growth. Anyone who is serious about combating climate change is going to need innovation and new technology. During Chancellor Angela Merkel's last visit to Beijing, she and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao agreed a very concrete agenda to tackle this issue. Companies from Germany and the EU have a lot of both to offer./////They have a strong interest in supporting China on its road towards becoming a low-carbon economy./////The economy is not everything, but without the economy, nothing else can work. Who would know this better than all of you./////The German Government attaches great importance to the cultural exchange between China and Europe, between China and Germany. We seek to know each other even better and learn from each other./////I thank all the companies and the city of Hamburg for their committed work in our festival ""Germany and China-Moving Ahead Together"". With a focus on sustainable urbanization, this series of events was far more than the traditional cultural year. I also extend my thanks to everyone who worked on our success at the Expo in Shanghai./////More than four million visitors showed great interest in our country./////Next spring, the National Museum of China's new premises in Beijing will open with an exhibition called ""The Art of Enlightenment"". And we also look forward to the year of Chinese culture in Germany in 2012./////Political action is far more than what governments do. Personal friendships, joint research projects and strong economic relations all contribute to mutual understanding and trust. In this light, let me express my gratitude to the organizers of this fourth Hamburg Summit./////I wish everyone here all the very best personally. And since my party membership is no secret I probably do not surprise you when I wish you all success in business as well./////Thank you for your attention./////",0.1
International trade,    27.08.2010 - Speech,"Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to Parliament in Pristina, Kosovo - Federal Foreign Office ",Speech,"__Translation of advance text__//////////Mr President,/////Mr Speaker,/////Mr Prime Minister,/////Members of Parliament,/////Ladies and gentlemen,//////////I view it as an honour and a privilege to address you in this House today. Thank you for your invitation.//////////Here in this House you will be charting Kosovo's path to a democratic and peaceful future.//////////Also as Foreign Minister, I remain a convinced parliamentarian.//////////What's so special about a democracy is not that it has a government.//////////What's so special about a democracy is that there is a parliament in which the whole nation is represented. In a democracy it is parliament that controls the government and not vice versa.//////////In parliament there is both a majority and a minority; that is where supporters of the government and representatives of the opposition debate how best to deal with the problems facing their country. Parliament is the living heart of any democracy. It is here that the nature of the relations between the majority and the minority in a country is decided.//////////As Members of Parliament you bear great responsibility for your country's welfare. You will be judged by Kosovo's citizens by how you live up to this responsibility.//////////I wish you and your still young Parliament a great future.//////////Now the International Court of Justice has delivered its opinion, it is clear that Kosovo's declaration of independence is in accordance with international law.//////////The Court has upheld the interpretation of the law shared also by the German Government.//////////Kosovo's independence does not signify any change in international legal norms.//////////The principles of the sovereign equality of states and the inviolability of borders are not compromised by this decision.//////////Germany was one of the first countries to recognize Kosovo as an independent country. This recognition marked a high point, yet certainly not the end point of our solidarity with the people of Kosovo, our support for a free, democratic, just and dynamic Kosovo.//////////Germany will stand by Kosovo also over the years ahead.//////////The independence of Kosovo closes the chapter of border changes and secession in the area that was once Yugoslavia. The map of the Western Balkans has now been redrawn. The independence of Kosovo and its territorial integrity are practical facts.//////////In the 20th century disputes over borders and areas of settlement served time and again as a pretext for armed attacks, bloodshed, war, murder and genocide on an unimaginable scale.//////////In the Europe of the 21st century there must be no repetition of these tragedies.//////////It is important to remember the past with all its suffering, yet this must not deflect us from building the future.//////////Anyone in Belgrade and Pristina who wields influence and wields this influence responsibly can have no interest in any escalation in Kosovo.//////////I would like to pay tribute to all those who ensured, with a true sense of responsibility, that the situation in Kosovo did not escalate following the country's declaration of independence.//////////I say this also and in particular in the direction of Belgrade and in the direction of the Serbs in Kosovo. I am confident it is now widely recognized that violence and destruction will do no one any good in the long run. To ensure that all ethnic groups in Kosovo can live together in peace is one of the great challenges facing political leaders.//////////With independence, Kosovo-Albanians became the majority population.//////////Every country that recognizes Kosovo does so in the expectation that this new status quo will be used responsibly.//////////The way national minorities are treated is an important yardstick for evaluating how humane a society is. The constitution of 2008 contains all the principles and guarantees needed to ensure that everyone in Kosovo, including the Kosovo Serbs as well as the Roma and all other minorities, can live in security and enjoy the same rights as their fellow citizens.//////////What is crucial now is to translate these constitutional principles into constitutional practice.//////////Kosovo has the means as well as an obligation to promote good relations between the country's different ethnic groups. I very much hope that Kosovo will one day be cited as an example of a functioning multi-ethnic society.//////////Accomplishing this is not going to be easy. Decades of being fettered and oppressed, and of retaliation, too, have inflicted deep wounds.//////////No one is calling for members of minority groups to give up their identities and from one day to the next to see themselves solely as Kosovars. To demand any such thing would also be wrong. A person's identity cannot simply be relabelled. Identity has many different facets. One of them is nationality, others are language, culture and family.//////////The 20th century saw plenty of experiments in which governments sought to make their citizens into the New Man and New Woman. All these experiments involved coercion and all of them failed.//////////The state cannot and must not impose any identity, but it can and must create the framework in which a sense of identity and belonging can grow.//////////That can happen only if all citizens enjoy the same rights and can all rely on the state to protect them.//////////People will feel they belong if they know their name and background is no bar to them becoming a judge or police officer, for example, and hence both a part of and a representative of the state.//////////Every government of Kosovo will also be judged by how far it lives up to its responsibility to protect the Serbian Orthodox monasteries and other cultural monuments here. It is right that this is now the job of Kosovo's police force. Nothing else would in the long term be compatible with Kosovo's sovereignty.//////////In Belgrade people are watching very closely to see how serious the new Republic of Kosovo is about protecting these monasteries and cultural monuments. These sites are part of your shared history, testimony that the Balkans have for centuries been home to many different peoples. I am confident that trust will develop between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the authorities in Kosovo.//////////In the EU and NATO the issue of who should be responsible for the security of the monasteries and cultural monuments was discussed in depth.//////////That KFOR has now handed this responsibility over to the Republic of Kosovo's security forces underlines our confidence in the Kosovo police force and our expectations of its performance. This responsibility means first and foremost an obligation. There must be no repetition of the kind of assaults and violence that took place in March 2004.//////////Reconciliation between the different ethnic groups requires time and patience. The suffering, humiliation, devastation and murder wrought by the Balkan wars must not deflect the region, however, from building a better future.//////////Perhaps only the children born in 2010, members of a generation with no first-hand experience of the past, will be able to feel this legacy as less of a burden. Reconciliation is vital, that is the only way everyone in Kosovo can live in peace and security both now and in the future.//////////The day will come when a representative of Kosovo sits around a table in Brussels with a representative of Serbia to discuss the future of the European Union along with Germany and the other member states.//////////Just a few years ago this would have seemed utopian to most people, but the history of European integration has shown that utopias can become reality.//////////After the devastation wreaked by two World Wars, many probably felt revenge, not reconciliation, was the better course. But despite the indescribable suffering Germany and the Germans had visited on them, Germany's neighbours chose the path of reconciliation.//////////It is impossible to overestimate how important this decision was for Europe's future. Over the decades this spirit of reconciliation generated the mutual trust which made European integration possible.//////////The history of Europe and the history of Germany teach that conflicts must be resolved peacefully. If that fails, in the end it will mean on both sides first and foremost victims, mothers and fathers who have lost sons, girls and boys who have lost fathers and brothers.//////////In Germany especially there was a long and heated debate in 1998 and 1999 over how we should respond to the looming catastrophe in Kosovo. The decision to send Bundeswehr troops into an area that was once Yugoslavia was not one that anyone in Germany took lightly.//////////But just as I am convinced that war signifies political failure, so I am equally convinced that Kosovo today can look forward to a European future because KFOR has done a good job.//////////That is above all due to the soldiers who have served with the Force. They include members of the Bundeswehr, to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks.//////////Today we don't hear much about KFOR outside Kosovo and that's a very good sign. The main stories in the media concern other international issues and conflicts. Violence and clashes in Kosovo are no longer headline news. That shows how successful KFOR has been.//////////Let me encourage you to pursue your road to Europe with confidence and a firm sense of purpose.//////////We all know that on this road towards Europe Kosovo still has tremendous challenges to overcome.//////////Here you can count on Germany's support.//////////Any company will take a close look at the situation in your country before investing money here. Although the recent global economic and financial crisis has not made international investors particularly risk-prone, they are nevertheless keenly interested in making strategic investments. German companies, too, have indicated their interest.//////////The more transparent tendering and procurement procedures are, the more companies will come. Other important factors in attracting investment are independent and functioning courts as well as fair and predictable customs procedures.//////////German support for the development of a multiethnic justice system and police force and an effective customs service helps make investing in Kosovo more attractive.//////////It is crucial that Kosovo should address the problems that are hampering economic growth. In its 2009 progress report the EU Commission noted deficits in combating corruption and organized crime. In this area more still needs to be done.//////////Over the past eleven years Germany has provided Kosovo with 340 million euro in bilateral aid to deal with the consequences of decades of neglect and to help build a new Kosovo.//////////When the banking system collapsed in the aftermath of the fighting, German money helped establish the first post-war bank in your country.//////////Today small and medium-sized enterprises and private households have access to credit.//////////When water and power shortages were a daily problem, Germany stepped in, too. Our Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau KfW is now working with four of the seven regional waterworks to improve the situation.//////////Last year Germany pledged a further 42 million euro in assistance. In the future, too, we will support infrastructure improvement in the form of more long-distance heating and environmentally sound water and power supplies.//////////What is important is that people in Kosovo feel things are moving forward. It is up to the politicians to prove it's worthwhile for them to roll up their sleeves, work hard and build a better future for their country. People need to get out of poverty and into paid work.//////////Women and men with good ideas are already making the most of Kosovo's new economic freedom. Individual initiative and the emergence of a middle class will drive the country's development forward.//////////Even now growth and new opportunities are evident especially in smaller enterprises, in commerce, agriculture, the trades and manufacturing.//////////Kosovo urgently needs economic growth if it is to offer its young people a future. These young men and women need to feel they can make a life for themselves in Kosovo. That's why Germany has since 2007 made education the priority area of our bilateral cooperation. We are advising on how to develop vocational training, on training programmes for teachers and adapting the vocational training system so that it meets local needs as well as normal EU standards.//////////The more Kosovo's young women and young men experience Europe as an area of freedom, the greater the commitment they will bring to building their European future. When I talk of freedom here, I most definitely mean also freedom to travel. The faster reforms become practical reality, the faster Kosovo's citizens can enjoy visa-free travel in Europe.//////////On my way to Pristina I visited Zagreb, Belgrade and Sarajevo. Everyone I talked to there fully realizes that it's good for everyone if their neighbours are prospering.//////////Stability throughout the region is of vital importance to all countries in the Western Balkans. This is a priority for the EU and this is a priority for me, too, as German Foreign Minister. With the necessary basis-good-neighbourly relations-in place, the integration of the Western Balkans countries into euro-atlantic structures can become reality.//////////Kosovo is now already a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group.//////////Germany will continue to work and campaign for the Republic of Kosovo to take its rightful place as soon as possible as a full member of the family of nations. Kosovo's future lies in an integrated Europe.//////////",0.2
International trade,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Foreign Minister Westerwelle in the Uruguayan weekly ""Busqueda"" - Federal Foreign Office ",Statement,"Germany's economic recovery is not yet stable, and the signals remain contradictory. What is your government's prediction for the rest of this year?/////Exports are rising again, and the German labour market remains resilient. We are sure that the economic recovery will continue in Germany, and we are trying to back this up at national and European level-domestically, we are creating growth impulses by reducing the burden on families and medium-sized businesses./////In 2010 the EU will begin implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, resulting in a major transfer of sovereignty from the Member States to the Union in the security and external relations fields. Is it possible to continue that process in the middle of an economic crisis which negatively impacts a large part of the continent?/////Europe's economic and financial crisis management has nothing to do with our efforts to cooperate even more closely on foreign and security policy. I agree that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to major changes in Europe's foreign policy, above all in institutional terms. By combining foreign-policy responsibilities we have the opportunity to present ourselves to a much greater extent as a single actor. The revamped format of ""High Representative of the Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy"", a post Catherine Ashton took over three months ago, will give the EU greater effectiveness and visibility./////Doesn't the fact that some countries fail to adhere to the Maastricht criteria on the coordination of macroeconomic policy make the European economic system less credible?/////The Lisbon Treaty imposes clear requirements on the eurozone members regarding new indebtedness and the level of debt. The Commission makes sure that these requirements are met, and it has the necessary sanction options to bring a member back into line. In my view this system has very much proved its worth, and it is a major factor in the eurozone financial framework's credibility./////The financial crisis which has had serious effects in countries like Greece and Spain, where the central banks are under suspicion for their handling of figures and financial statements regarding budget deficits and debts, has for the first time posed a challenge to the common currency, the euro. What measures will your country propose should this manipulation of data be confirmed?/////Unfortunately, with regard to Greece, it is now clear that the budget and debt figures have been incorrectly reported over a lengthy period. We have to learn the right lessons from this. It is already clear that the Commission, the eurozone members and Eurostat will need to examine national financial data much more closely in future, and that more decisive action must be taken to clarify even the slightest signs of possible irregularities./////This year China will for the first time overtake Germany as the world's leading export nation. How will your country react, in view of the expansion of China and other emerging countries?/////Germany will remain a strong exporting nation, of that I have no doubt. It is of secondary importance whether or not we are still export world champion. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We must maintain our competitiveness and aim for technological leadership. With innovative, high-quality products and technology-for example in the energy, biotechnology and telecommunications sectors-we will bolster our export strength./////For a long time Europe and the United States ignored the lack of democracy and freedoms in China. Has the time now come to confront Beijing with these issues?/////Germany champions freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide, and that is why we openly discuss the difficult situation faced by civil-rights campaigners and dissidents in China or the Tibetans' right to their cultural identity. This was the case during my last visit to Beijing, and it will continue to be the case in future./////Germany is a member of the group of negotiators trying to persuade Iran to abandon its current nuclear development plan. A recent UN report shows that this Islamic state is progressing towards the production of weapons of mass destruction. Does Germany feel the moment has arrived for strict sanctions against the Tehran regime? What kind of sanctions does Germany have in mind?/////While Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes, it cannot arm itself with nuclear weapons. This is why the international negotiating group pursues a dual-track approach, offering Iran broad cooperation in the economic and technological fields in return for an opening by Iran and fulfilment of the international community's demands. Failing this, we reserve the right to take further measures. Germany is also prepared to extend the sanctions should Iran continue to spurn our outstretched hand./////In Cuba a political prisoner has just died during a hunger strike. Do you think Europe should change its policy towards those Latin American countries which fail to fully respect human rights?/////We were greatly saddened at the tragic death of Orlando Zapata that should not have happened. The Cuban Government must finally release all political prisoners and grant international humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails. Standing up for human rights is, by the way, one of the central tenets of German and European foreign policy-also of course with regard to Latin America./////The EU and Mercosur have returned to the negotiating table to make further progress towards signing a free trade agreement. Can an agreement even be reached, given the current economic uncertainty? And can Europe amend its agricultural policy, as called for by Mercosur, in order to conclude an agreement?/////We want an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement with Mercosur. It would be of great value at this particular time, when both sides are keen to stimulate their economies again. As far as European agricultural policy is concerned, there is an important link between the free trade agreement and the Doha Round, which we want to succeed. That is why the EU has made an advance concession and undertaken considerable efforts to ensure improved market access for agricultural products. Progress in the Doha Round would undoubtedly bring progress in the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement too./////What expectations does the German Government have of the Uruguayan Government led by Jose Mujica?/////President Mujica has made clear what the priorities of his term in office will be-creating jobs, combating poverty and undertaking further educational and health-care reforms. Germany wants to further extend its bilateral relations with Uruguay, and following my talks with President Mujica I know that in him Germany has an open and committed interlocutor./////Is Germany concerned that the new Uruguayan Government has announced gestures of rapprochement towards regimes such as that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela?/////Every country has the right to shape its own relations. I don't see anything unusual in Uruguay and Venezuela, two regional partners, being in contact. Uruguay is a member of Mercosur, while Venezuela is on its way to membership./////The German foreign ministry has urged its Uruguayan counterpart to make sure that the Nazi eagle salvaged from the Graf Spee, which still lies wrecked on the bed of the Rio de la Plata, is not exhibited. What is the reason behind this stance, given that in Germany Nazi symbols are exhibited as part of its culture of remembrance? What did you request that the new foreign minister do in this regard?/////We want to prevent parts of the wreckage, and above all the stern eagle and swastika, from entering the militaria trade. Only in this way can we make sure that the wreckage is not misused to glorify or trivialize Nazi thinking. We are of course keen to shed more light on historical events surrounding the Graf Spee, and we therefore propose that the wreckage be exhibited, on the authority of the Uruguayan State, in its proper historical context./////",0.1
International trade,    10.03.2010 - Interview,"Interview: Westerwelle in the Brazilian newspaper__olha de São Paulo"" - Federal Foreign Office ",summit,"Germany is viewed as the most probable guarantor for Greek debt in the current crisis and there are rumours that the German Government and German banks are preparing to help Athens in order to save the euro. After the most recent meeting on this issue last month, however, it was said that Federal Chancellor Merkel stopped the aid package from being publicly announced due to concerns over negative opinion polls and, incidentally, that she is against such a package. Now that Greece has made new promises to cut expenditures, is the German Government prepared to take action?/////First, let me start by saying that I am happy to be here in Brazil. Germany and Brazil are not only the largest economies on their respective continents-we also share many common values. To answer your question, we do not make policy on the basis of opinion polls. The truth is that the Greek Government was given clear requirements by the European Commission regarding how and when it needed to return to the course of budget consolidation. I am happy and satisfied that Greece has taken energetic steps to meet these requirements. The markets also seem to have recognized these steps. Now it is important for Greece to also do its homework. We expressly support Greece in this process./////The current crisis concerning Greece has resulted in a number of accusations being made in both countries' media. Greece went so far as to refer to the Second World War, while the German media deemed the Greeks ""traitors"" to the euro. To what extent has this crisis revealed divisions within the euro zone and what does this mean for the future of relations within the bloc?/////Individual opinions should not be overrated and they certainly should not be confused with the position of the respective government. Germany and Greece are close partners in Europe. The euro members are handling the current crisis carefully and are working in close coordination. And we will continue to do so./////Last year Germany lost its title of exports champion to China. Will Berlin simply accept this as reality or are there hopes of regaining the top position in world trade?/////There is absolutely no doubt that Germany will remain a strong exporting nation. In the end, whether we hold the title of ""exports champion"" or not is secondary. Don't forget the demographic realities-China's population is over 15 times that of Germany. We are convinced that producing innovative, quality products is the best way to guarantee our strength as an exporting nation./////Contrary to expectations, the German economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the German Government's opinion, how long will this stagnation last? Is there a threat of recession without a new stimulus package?/////It is true that the expected economic growth in the last quarter was less than we had hoped for. On the other hand, there is also some good news: exports are picking up again and the German labour market is also continuing to look robust. We support economic development at the national as well as the European level. At the national level, we are stimulating growth through tax relief for families and small businesses./////The first five months of the ""black-yellow"" (Christian Democrat/Free Democrat) coalition have been characterized by quarrelling within and between the parties, public accusations and a sharp downturn for the FDP in public opinion polls. To what extent do these tensions present a risk to the coalition's ability to govern the country?/////Opinion polls change as often as the weather. We have to do what is right. Germany has a stable new government that has defined a clear path./////One of the key points of conflict within the Federal Government is the future of the German welfare state. In this discussion, which is of central importance to the CDU, you made a reference to the period of decadence in the late Roman empire. How can these fundamentally different positions be reconciled without alienating the FDP and CDU from their respective voter bases?/////The future of the welfare state is an issue that is very important to me. Over 60% of the federal budget goes to social purposes and interest payments. This money has to be earned. The public debate we are having in Germany on these issues demonstrates just how important fair compensation is to people./////The Federal Government has delayed making a number of difficult decisions, on tax reform for example, until after the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia in May in order to counter the risk of losing its majority in the Bundesrat (upper house of parliament). Isn't this just postponing decisions that are inevitable anyway? Will it be possible here to find a common denominator in order for the country to move forward?/////You shouldn't construct connections that don't exist. A comprehensive tax or health reform, which I believe is necessary and which we agreed on with our coalition partner, doesn't happen overnight. We have only been in office a few months-a bit more patience is required./////How do you view the recent rapprochement between President Lula and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad? What role could Brazil play in helping to resolve the crisis over Iran's nuclear programme?/////Brazil plays a very important role-and not just because your country is currently a member of the UN Security Council. Our position regarding Iran's nuclear programme is clear: like every other country, Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes. But Iran does not have the right to develop nuclear weapons. That is why we are pursuing a dual-track approach in the international negotiations: we are offering extensive cooperation in the areas of business and technology if Iran is transparent and finally meets the international community's demands. However, due to Iran's adamant refusal to meet these requirements, time is running out. That is why the international community will have to increase pressure on Iran./////On various occasions, you and President Lula have shared similar positions on the need for a treaty on nuclear disarmament. The Brazilian Government criticizes the Non-Proliferation Treaty in particular because it does not specify obligations for the nuclear powers to disarm and has thus created a system of double standards regarding who is allowed to have nuclear weapons and who isn't. That is why Brazil is not planning to approve the revision of the Treaty. What will Germany's position be at the nuclear security conference in Washington this April?/////Here it is important to keep separate issues separate. The content of the global nuclear security summit in Washington in April has little to do with the NPT Review Conference in May. If we want to make the vision of a world without nuclear weapons-as described by President Obama-a reality, we have to ensure that nuclear material cannot fall into the hands of criminals or terrorists. This is what we will be discussing in Washington. We have to adopt specific steps for how we will prevent the unauthorized access to nuclear material. This is what we hope to contribute to in Washington./////At the Copenhagen Climate Conference, the EU put all its eggs in one basket and pursued very ambitious goals. In the end though, it was not possible to win over the developing countries and the EU was excluded from the preparations of the Copenhagen Accord. What happened?/////In Copenhagen, Germany and the EU worked to achieve an ambitious climate policy. Europe played a leading role, and this was recognized. Even after Copenhagen, Europe's commitments to climate protection are still valid and have not been compromised. Unfortunately so far important partners have not yet been able to commit to a similarly ambitious approach./////Concerning the Copenhagen Accord, it is simply not possible to negotiate such a declaration in a group of 194 States parties to the climate convention. What matters is that ultimately the Copenhagen Accord is the product of all participating states./////After the failure in Copenhagen, which forum do you consider to be best-suited to establishing a common global policy for countering climate change? What steps will Germany take if the project of a global approach fails?/////There is no alternative to a climate agreement within the framework of the United Nations. Climate policy used to be regarded as an issue for environmental experts. However, climate protection is a global challenge that also affects foreign policy. That is why foreign policy experts in particular should be closely involved in the negotiation process. We have to broaden the climate dialogue much more than we have in the past. On this issue, Brazil is an especially important partner./////",0.1
International trade,    06.09.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle at the opening of the Ambassadors Conference at the Federal Foreign Office - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advence text __/////Esteemed Colleague,/////Excellencies,/////Members of the German Bundestag,/////Guests and friends of the Federal Foreign Office,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////I bid you a warm welcome to this year's conference of heads of German missions abroad./////It's a special pleasure for me to welcome my Mexican colleague Patricia Espinosa Cantellano as today's guest of honour. Many of you know her as a former ambassador to our country, as a friend of Germany and of the German language. We're very pleased to have you here!/////Ladies and gentlemen, during the past few months I've visited many of you in your missions. Some of you are here for the first time. I'm looking forward to discussing the direction and focuses of German foreign policy with you over the next few days./////Our work is often determined by our unsettled world's current crises and conflicts. It's therefore all the more important to have a clear view of the long-term challenges. For that reason I want to concentrate today on the three major priorities I see for German foreign policy and which we've already made serious efforts to tackle in past months://///First, shaping globalization through values-based and interest-oriented policies./////Second, a German peace and security policy built around disarmament and non-proliferation, in close cooperation with our allies and partners./////Third, strengthening and advancing European integration as the foundation of German foreign policy./////I./////If we want to shape globalization we need like-minded partners. Four weeks ago the Federal Government adopted a comprehensive Latin America concept. Latin America is the focus of this first Ambassadors Conference to be held during my term in office. I'm well aware that some people derided this choice at the beginning, but those who, like me, have experienced this continent's spirit of renewal and fantastic dynamism, as well as its affinity to Europe, will know what opportunities and potential this region possesses./////A German foreign policy that sees itself as both values-based and interest-oriented has always set its sights on both aspects. As a major trading nation we must have the big picture of global dynamism. This is why, during my first months in office, I travelled to China, Russia and Africa. In a few weeks' time we will on behalf of the Federal Government present a new Africa concept designed to revamp our policy towards this continent, too./////This October I will visit India./////However, I also visited Latin America because I see these countries as our natural partners in shaping globalization. Latin America is characterized to a greater extent than other regions outside the ""West"" by the values of the European Enlightenment. We share the values of individual liberty and the rule of law with most countries in this region./////Over the coming months and years Latin America will increasingly become the focus of attention. This November, in Cancun in Mexico, we will renew our efforts towards international climate protection. Mexico will take over the chair of the G20 from our French neighbours. In 2014 during the FIFA World Cup, and during the 2016 Olympic Games, the eyes of the world will be on Brazil. Latin America is a multi-faceted continent, and we want to help it find solutions to its most pressing issues, such as internal security. But above all I want to focus attention on the huge opportunities and the political and social potential which lie in closer relations with Latin America./////We need strong partners like Latin America so that we can back up the globalization of markets with the globalization of values./////To give globalization a human face we need a strong United Nations in line with 21st century reality. The greater significance of the Southern countries must be reflected in the Security Council. We're working for a reform of the Security Council to ensure that Africa and Latin America are also permanently represented./////Germany is facing up to its responsibility in the UN. While a permanent seat on the Security Council is our long-term policy aim, Germany is currently standing for non-permanent membership of the Council for 2011 and 2012./////Our election campaign is making good progress. With your daily work you are creating the trust your host countries' governments place in Germany, and for this I thank you. Keep up this good work so that we will have the majority we need during the elections in the General Assembly in mid October!/////Global trade isn't what's new about globalization-we've had that for centuries. The new factor is time, the incredible speed with which it takes place. As late as the 19th century major economic and social changes often took 50 years to happen. Today maybe 15 or 20 years can decide whether nations rise or fall./////A nation's wealth is no longer mainly its raw materials. Education is becoming more and more important. Knowledge arises from hard work, not from geological coincidence. We need more education out of respect for the generations to come. Children don't need good schools so that they do well in the PISA test, they need schools so that they can make the best use of their talents and live life to the fullest./////It's also a question of our society's competitiveness. We need good schools and universities to hold our own in the global competition for the brightest students. Only if our universities remain attractive can we keep our high flyers in Germany, only then will we encourage gifted young people from other countries to study here./////In this case, too, interests and values interact. Those who return home after studying here maintain links with Germany and disseminate our values in their own countries. Our cultural relations and education policy makes Germany more competitive, while at the same time helping to globalize our values./////An active cultural relations and education policy isn't a luxury but wise and far-sighted. Partner schools and Goethe-Institute, university partnerships and the promotion of talented young people are elements of a foreign and globalization policy which is in Germany's vested interests./////Latin America gives us many examples of such cooperation. Together with Chile and Colombia we have set up Centres of Excellence. In São Paulo, the largest German business community abroad, a German Science and Innovation Forum is being created. In Buenos Aires we will open a German-Argentinian University Centre and a Max Planck Partner Institute. In Mexico there are German professorships./////Dear colleague, you are living proof of Germany's cultural relations and education policy. I first met Patricia Espinosa Cantellano this April. She went to the German School in Mexico, speaks excellent German, and was her country's ambassador in Berlin and Vienna. Our shared language and access to culture links us and enables us to cooperate to the benefit of both our countries./////Mexico and Germany are ideal partners in the quest for values-based globalization. During the next few months, dear colleague, you can count on our support in making the Cancun climate summit a success under your chairmanship./////Education policy is just one example of the extent to which our country's influence abroad depends on our performance at home. Domestic and foreign policy are becoming increasingly interlinked. Only an economically strong country can have sufficient foreign-policy clout./////It's therefore important not only from a domestic-policy but also from a foreign-policy standpoint that we take the right road in the financial and economic crisis. The Federal Government's budget cuts are painful, also for the Federal Foreign Office, but if we use our budget wisely Germany will in the medium term have more, rather than less, of a role to play on the foreign policy stage./////II./////The second key priority is a German security and peace policy that is in keeping with the times./////On a current note, let me first say that Germany will do everything in its power to help ensure success of the direct talks that have just begun between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is the two sides that have to make peace with one another. That we cannot do for them. But we will continue to do all we can to strengthen the forces of reason and reconciliation. The first German-Palestinian Steering Committee that met this spring in Berlin has taken our cooperation with the Palestinians to a new level. This close cooperation has met with strong approval not only in the Arab world, but also in Israel. That is important to us-because the security and bright future of Israel is and will remain a fundamental pillar of German policy./////At the beginning of this government's term of office, there was a need to reshape Germany's engagement in Afghanistan. We have done a level-headed and honest stocktaking./////This included reassessing the operation and determining that, from an international humanitarian law perspective, it is an armed conflict. On this basis, we have drawn up a strategy that, first, realistically defines our objectives, second, brings deployment of our military and civilian assets in line with these objectives and, third, clearly highlights the need for a political solution./////The mission in Afghanistan is certainly not popular. But it remains necessary, and it serves our core security interests. Looking at the country today, it still presents a mixed picture with more and less encouraging developments. Yet in recent months we have achieved a great deal, and we want to continue our steady progress down this path./////At the London Conference in January, we closely coordinated our strategy both within NATO and with the international community./////We have markedly increased our presence in Afghanistan at all levels. I would like to extend to the diplomats, service members, police officers and reconstruction workers my deep respect and gratitude for the duties they are performing there for our country, in very difficult conditions./////A few weeks ago in Kabul, we set out a roadmap. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 18 September, and they are the first to be organized under sole Afghan responsibility. This November at the NATO Summit in Lisbon, we will be taking a decision on whether to hand over security responsibility in several regions of the country./////By 2014, we want to have transferred security responsibility for the entire country to the Government of Afghanistan, in line with President Karzai's objective./////By following this roadmap, we are creating the real prospect for a withdrawal of our women and men in uniform, and for an Afghanistan in which Afghan women and men once again will take charge of their own destiny. Yet our benchmark remains that a threat to international security must no longer emanate from Afghanistan./////Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan is key to stabilizing the entire region. The flooding in recent weeks has caused unthinkable destruction and human suffering./////We have provided rapid and effective assistance; beyond the humanitarian aid offered during the initial weeks, we will remain engaged in reconstruction and political reform efforts. Pakistan deserves to be a special focus of our attention, on both a humanitarian and political level./////Despite these crises that we are facing right now, we must not lose sight of the long-term security and peace policy challenges. On Sunday, we will mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the 2+4 Treaty, a masterpiece of foreign policy and a milestone on the path to German unity. This is a fitting occasion to thank our partners and allies in the transatlantic community for helping bring about a Germany that is united and free./////The Alliance remains the foundation of our security. But the world has changed in fundamental ways. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a significant increase in the nuclear threat due to the proliferation of weapons and missile technology. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons poses one of the greatest threats to our security. Mitigating this development is a question of survival. Disarmament is therefore not a 1980s issue, and it is not a pipe dream; rather, in our globalized world, it is a necessity./////The conclusion of a new START Treaty between Russia and the United States marked the encouraging beginning to a decade that must become a decade of disarmament./////At the NPT Review Conference held in New York last May, tactical nuclear weapons were for the first time included in the disarmament effort, which was a success for the policies of this Federal Government and the German Bundestag./////It is our aim, on the one hand, to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and, on the other hand, to reduce the existing stockpiles of these weapons. These are two sides of the same coin. That is why the controversy surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme goes far beyond its regional implications; it is in fact a global issue./////We are going to great lengths to ensure that disarmament and arms control will remain a key issue, also within NATO's new Strategic Concept that is to be adopted at the Lisbon Summit in November. This will create the opportunity for us to devise a truly cooperative security architecture for all of Europe, expressly including Russia. The initiative presented by myself together with the Foreign Ministers of the Benelux countries and Norway at the meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Tallinn last April regarding the reduced significance of nuclear weapons within NATO served this same purpose./////In the long term, we remain committed to President Obama's Global Zero vision, that is a world without nuclear weapons. We have quite a long way to go. But in formulating our policy, we will not lose sight of this goal./////Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction already on their own pose a great threat to us all. We must do everything within our power to prevent them from entering unholy alliances, and their becoming a curse brought about by globalization./////III./////Probably the greatest challenge, but also the most rewarding task, of German foreign policy is the construction of Europe./////A united Europe is the foundation on which German foreign policy rests. Europe is not everything, but without Europe everything is nothing./////In May, we needed to take two consecutive, very difficult decisions to shield the euro-and thus Europe-from a severe crisis. These difficult weeks made it clear to all of us that European integration must be fought for again and again. It is not a permanent condition. It is also not ""irreversible"". Eurobarometer public opinion polls point to a dramatic drop in Europe's approval rating in Germany. I am deeply worried about this, but I am also highly determined to work for, and champion the cause of, the construction of Europe. I ask you all to join me in this effort./////For us Germans, a united Europe is not some luxury that we could, if need be, do without. It guarantees our prosperity, our peace and our freedom./////To keep it this way, we Europeans must make progress on reducing deficits, and we must put in place strict rules governing new borrowing. This is the only option for restoring sound growth to Europe. It is obviously in all EU member states' own interest to keep the euro healthy. Stability of the euro is everyone's responsibility. If anyone opts out of our common responsibility for Europe, this must automatically have consequences in the form of sanctions./////Rule violators should be barred from receiving money from the EU Structural Funds. These sanctions must apply to everyone, no matter how large or powerful a European country it may be. We want a European Union of responsibility, and not one of transfer payments, where a country can shirk responsibility and hope for a bailout. These are our objectives in ongoing negotiations within the van Rompuy led group./////Strengthening cohesion within the European Union is dear to my heart. For a strong and united Europe, we want to reinforce ties with partners to our east as much as to our west, ties that have been nurtured over decades. My first trip abroad as Foreign Minister was to Warsaw. Germany's relations with France and with Poland are both top priority. Here, there is no ""either _ or"", it is always an ""and""./////We have successfully reactivated the Weimar Triangle. It is becoming a driving force of European policy./////During my first year in office, I visited European member states regardless of their population size-because the European project has no use for sorting countries according to their importance; rather, all member states must stand as one./////Only on the basis of this internal cohesion can we use Europe's international clout to our advantage. In the coming days, we will hold intensive discussions in Brussels about Europe's relations with strategic partners such as China and India./////During my recent travels to Turkey and the Western Balkan countries, I saw that the European project for peace and prosperity remains as attractive as ever. In these countries, the prospect of drawing closer to the EU is probably the strongest factor driving reform./////In all of this we must, however, be certain that our citizens stand behind our policies. Europe is only strong when its citizens support the construction of Europe and recognize the truly inestimable value it holds for our country./////Before I ask my Mexican colleague to take the floor, I want to address an issue that many of my co workers here at this ministry have been giving much thought to, namely the future of our foreign service./////The world is constantly changing, regardless of our need to save money. Across the globe, power is shifting. We must closely examine and adapt how we use our resources. At the same time, we are in the process of establishing a European External Action Service./////This will cause some of you to wince and say that, in your area, efficiencies have been maximized, changes and savings are simply not possible. My answer to this is, you must view this situation as an opportunity./////Continual change is one of the few constant factors of diplomatic life. Just as you have done for yourself, the Federal Foreign Office must develop an institutional culture of change. Who would know better than you which changes are required? Let me thank all Foreign Office staff, from local staff to ambassadors, who have contributed to the fruitful discussions on our intranet ""forum for the future""./////We will discuss the results during this Ambassadors Conference, for one thing. But the project ""AA 2020"" will continue, so that the Foreign Office will remain ready and able to lead German foreign policy./////In the diplomacy business, one must always be prepared for the unexpected. Crises, whether natural disasters or man made, are not predictable./////We require structures that can quickly adapt to changes. Above all, we need staff who find the right solutions in unusual situations. During the ten months that I have been in office, I have again and again been reaffirmed in my view that Foreign Office staff do great work and effectively promote our country's interests abroad. I know that their efforts are also highly respected in the German Bundestag./////Please take my thanks back to your missions, pass it on to your colleagues, and especially also to their families and partners./////For centuries, Germans have found a new home in Latin America, where they have seized opportunities and achieved success. Today we are partners in globalization. I am pleased about our long-standing, close ties with Mexico that are based on trust, and I now have the honour to hand the floor over to the Secretary of Foreign Relations of the United Mexican States./////Dear Colleague, dear Patricia, over to you./////",0.1
International trade,    09.04.2010 - Speech,Speech by Guido Westerwelle at a dinner hosted by the Southern African German Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text__/////Mr Boddenberg,/////Mr Moller,/////Ladies and gentlemen,/////Thank you very much for welcoming me here today and for your kind introductory words./////On behalf of the entire delegation, I thank you most warmly for inviting us to this beautiful Club. Please also accept belated Easter greetings from Berlin./////This year is arguably the most important year for South Africa since apartheid was finally vanquished in 1994. President Jacob Zuma himself said as much only a few weeks ago./////I believe that 2010 is a crucial year not only for South Africa, but for us all-a year in which we set the course for the future./////We have just had to face the toughest economic and financial crisis-the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression of 1929./////We are still left struggling with the consequences-in Africa, Europe, all over the world./////The public finances of nearly all OECD countries have found themselves in troubled waters, and here in Africa the crisis has made a deep dent in the most consistent economic upturn in the continent's history./////I can well imagine that you of all people, as representatives of private business, must be feeling the pinch and would have your own stories to tell./////However, I can also say that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We can feel it in Germany, in the EU, but here in Africa too./////A few days ago at an economic forum in Nairobi, the IMF Managing Director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stressed that the year 2010 would see a return to growth in Africa too. ""Africa is back"" is how he put it./////""Africa is back""-at first this may seem a rather strange notion to many observers in Germany and Europe. We perceive the African continent all too often as a continent of conflicts, crises and catastrophes./////However, I know not only from my discussions in the United Republic of Tanzania and today in Pretoria, but also from early trips, that nothing could be more false than this negative image of Africa. Sometimes, I admit, one has to dig a little deeper to see the potential and unearth new opportunities./////However, if we take the trouble, there is no limit to what we can discover and achieve. Germany and South Africa-Europe and its neighbouring continent-have a wealth of values, interests and goals in common./////Let me give you a brief outline of three areas of cooperation that I consider to be of crucial importance for this year, but also well beyond 2010./////First, we need to come together both to address the most pressing challenges in security policy and draw attention to global issues./////South Africa is our strategic partner in Africa, which is especially true with regard to our efforts to build peace and security on the continent./////We are together promoting the development of rule-of-law structures in southern Sudan by means of a trilateral training programme for Sudanese judges and public prosecutors. Particularly in this critical phase for the Sudan, in which landmark decisions are to be made regarding the country's future, we must not slacken our efforts to establish a minimum rule-of-law standard. Without peace and stability in the Sudan the development of the entire region is threatened./////Particularly when it comes to solving the crisis in Zimbabwe, South Africa is the key player and President Zuma is continually engaged personally in this process. Together we must play our part in ensuring that the intended power-sharing between the various political groups succeeds. We want a government in Zimbabwe that includes all political forces-a government that is not based on fear, intimidation and persecution but that respects human rights and the principles of the rule of law./////Germany and South Africa are also working closely together on developing a pan-African security architecture. South Africa is the driving force behind both the regional association SADC and the African Union./////Here Germany stands firmly by South Africa's side-supporting, for instance, the African Union in developing a Peace Support Operations Centre in Addis Ababa and training Somali police officers in Ethiopia./////South Africa is also our strategic partner on the continent when it comes to major global issues. South Africa is a partner in the G20, where we consult closely on the most important issues relating to the international financial and economic system. We are also working together within the framework of international climate negotiations for an ambitious follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol./////I am especially delighted that, in nominating Minister of Tourism-formerly Minister for Environmental Affairs and Tourism-Marthinus van Schalkwyk, South Africa has proposed an outstanding candidate to lead the UN Climate Change Secretariat in my home town Bonn./////Let me turn now to another area of cooperation that is crucial for Germany and South Africa: economic development and economic cooperation./////South Africa is by far Germany's most important economic partner in Africa: worldwide South Africa ranks seventh place among Germany's non-European trading partners. At the same time Germany is South Africa's second most important trading partner worldwide./////There are currently around 600 German companies in South Africa and together they have created a total of 90,000 jobs. The main focuses of German enterprise are car manufacture, chemicals, and mechanical and electrical engineering./////Why do I make a point of stating this? I do this because, particularly as a politician and Foreign Minister of liberal persuasion, I am firmly convinced that economic links, investment, trade and entrepreneurship are crucial for jobs, growth and prosperity./////However, economic exchange is also indeed crucial to the peaceful coexistence of peoples and nations-and thus in our best national and European interests./////This applies even more in the age of globalization, where we can use our economic links to bring about a globalization of values as well. In this way globalization becomes a win-win situation for both sides, and not just economically./////As I see it, external economic promotion is therefore a key element in any foreign policy with an eye to the future. This applies even more to a country like Germany, where so much importance is attached to exports and to economic links as a whole./////Here I would like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution. I cannot praise highly enough the work of the German Chambers of Commerce Abroad: a total of 120 spread across 80 different countries. Not only do they open doors: they also build bridges./////They are ambassadors for our country and our economy. I especially welcome your commit­ment with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility. Social responsibility is not an alien concept to German businesses, at home or abroad; rather, it is part and parcel of a modern business philosophy that is in keeping with the times. This is the globalization of values in action./////I strongly encourage you to continue along this path. I'm sure your efforts will shine through, both in the quality of your products and, ultimately, in your balance sheets./////I also speak for my colleague Dirk Niebel, who is accompanying me on this Africa tour, when I say this. By the way, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first major trip to Africa in almost twenty years by a Federal Foreign Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development./////There is no place for institutional rivalry in the tasks that lie ahead. On the contrary, what we require is a seamless policy on Africa. This will also find its expression in the Federal Government's strategy for Africa, which we are working on together./////This is especially true in the case of a partner country like South Africa, which has long since outgrown the classic label of developing country and is itself now a development aid provider./////This makes it all the more important that we reach agreement on specific areas where we share a common interest, for instance on energy and climate policy, climate technology, or vocational training. The intergovernmental negotiations which ended today, that focused on defining the priorities for our future work, set a most encouraging tone for our continuing cooperation in areas of relevance to the years to come./////Finally, I would like to address a third area of cooperation that is especially close to my heart and relevant here to our policy on Africa: cultural relations and education policy./////We live in the age of globalization. This is not an aspect we can choose to switch on or off at our convenience, but a fact of life that we have to come to terms with, for better or worse./////I believe globalization brings with it immense opportunities. Politically and economically, but also culturally. Where distances shrivel to nothing and communication knows no limits, there the principles of cultural understanding can flourish-the principles by which we learn not only from one another but in each other's best interests./////This is precisely the approach we need: active promotion of the German language, particu­larly in Africa; strengthening the Goethe-Institut; cooperating in education, science and sport. Having just visited the science park and innovation centre, I have been deeply impressed by how much South Africa in particular is investing in research and innovation, in the develop­ment of high-tech solutions./////Knowledge is the key resource of the 21st century. Education is the social issue of the age of globalization./////This is as true for Europe as it is for Africa. Enhanced cooperation in the fields of education, research and innovation is therefore exactly the right way to capitalize together on the oppor­tunities that globalization affords-and this applies to South Africa just as much as it does to Germany./////Africa is on the ascent. The continent's population is young, motivated and hungry for education./////A few weeks ago, the American publication Newsweek was talking about the possibility of Africa becoming the new Asia./////With its increasing buying power, a new middle class is emerging that is bolstering domestic demand. A middle class whose motivation and zeal ensure that more and more international companies are discovering Africa as a location for investment. And finally, a middle class that wants political participation and upholds the values of democracy and the rule of law./////We want to strengthen these positive forces on the African continent: we want to support Africa in its ascent-with policies that favour partnership in the pursuit of peace and stability, in the pursuit of economic development and cultural understanding./////It is 62 days to kick-off. South Africa is to host this year's FIFA World Cup. The enthusiasm is already palpable. I am certain that this first FIFA World Cup on African soil will be a mega event-a unique opportunity for the country, indeed for the whole continent./////Let us use this mood of optimism to promote a new image of the African continent-one that moves far beyond the old doom and gloom or an all too naive African romanticism./////We need a realistic image of Africa, one that recognizes the opportunities as well as the challenges that lie ahead. If we can succeed in this, then together we can reach the right decisions, so that 2010 becomes not just the ""first post-crisis year"", but a year when we all make the ascent together./////Thank you very much./////",0.2
International trade,    21.01.2011 - Speech,Speech by Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle in the German Bundestag on the occasion of the first reading of the draft mandate for extending Germany's participation in ISAF in Afghanistan - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"Mr President! Ladies and gentlemen!/////It is not by chance that today's debate on Afghanistan and the situation in the country began with a policy statement by Dirk Niebel, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. This clearly shows that we must give prominence not only to the military service that our men and women of the Bundeswehr are performing there. Since so many service members are present here today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to you and to your comrades, on behalf of this House, for everything you are doing in Afghanistan./////Of course we also know-and the servicemen and women are especially aware of this-that we will not succeed in Afghanistan if we place all our faith in a military solution. Our military commitment serves to bolster stability in Afghanistan. The visible progress that has been made on civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan is highly remarkable. No other German Government has been engaged in civilian reconstruction in Afghanistan to the extent the current Government has. No other German Government has done as much for building up and training Afghan security forces as the current Government has. May I ask you to take this into account when criticizing us. The situation was different when you were in power./////However, civilian reconstruction and safeguarding these achievements with a view to the country's stability can of course only be part of the solution. The political solution is what matters most. This realization is at the heart of the shift in strategy that took place almost exactly one year ago at the London Conference on Afghanistan. At the time, this strategy shift was highly controversial, also in this House. But it is becoming clear that what the German Government negotiated in London together with its partners was right. We will not achieve peace in Afghanistan by military means, but only through a political solution. Our international engagement therefore aims to bring about a political solution, with a view to creating sustainable and lasting stability in Afghanistan-so that also once our engagement has ended, the country will not again become a safe haven and refuge for international terrorism./////It is key to this political process that all actors be involved. It is paramount that we are ever more successful in our efforts towards regional involvement, that is to say involving affected neighbouring countries. A start was made in London with the Conference on Afghanistan. Subsequently, for the first time, a conference on Afghanistan-attended by all actors-was held in Kabul, that is, in the country itself. Participants included, one should note, those neighbouring countries that have not taken part in the process for years. At this conference, agreements were also reached between Afghanistan and Pakistan. From a Central European vantage point, such trade agreements would appear easy to conclude. Yet anyone with background knowledge about relations between the two countries knows that these agreements represent a huge step forward. Regarding Iran, there are many questions-I am thinking, for example, of those relating to the drug trafficking-that can only be answered by involving neighbouring countries and through relevant networking. All of this happened./////Late last year, NATO held its summit in Lisbon. It was a true milestone. I would like to again mention the four dates-not just three-of our road map, of our strategy for the future://///First, during the first half of this year, we want to begin transferring responsibility for local security in the districts and provinces./////Second, we are confident that, by the end of the year, we will be able to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time./////Third, by the end of 2014 we should have succeeded in completely transferring responsibility for local security to the Afghans. This is not only our aim, it is also the express aim of the Afghan Government that there will no longer be any of our combat troops in the country./////The fourth point is often forgotten. Also beyond 2014, Germany must remain actively committed to sustainable security in Afghanistan. Were we not to do so, the Taliban would immediately regain the upper hand. They would again sow the seeds of terrorism throughout the world, and all efforts, also those of our Bundeswehr men and women, would have been in vain. We would be back to square one. There must be no second vacuum left behind in Afghanistan. This is what we believe is at stake./////In the policy statement I delivered in December 2010, I commented on this in detail. Contrary to everything that has been insinuated in this connection, it is totally clear that every road map is always contingent on the situation actually turning out as foreseen. By the way, this has not only been included in the text of the mandate for the first time, but is word for word what I said in my policy statement on behalf of the German Government in December./////In other words: by the end of 2011, we want to reduce the presence of our Bundeswehr forces for the first time. Yet it is self-understood that, for all of this, the following conditions must be met: only if the situation permits, and only if our servicemen and women on the ground are not endangered. Because what we want is an irreversible and sustainable process of transfer of responsibility. This is the objective.///// (_)/////The German Government is confident that, as security responsibility is progressively handed over, the presence of Bundeswehr forces can be reduced, starting at the end of 2011. The German Government will use all of the leverage that is justifiable in terms of security policy to draw down forces as early as possible-if the situation permits, and provided that neither our service members nor the sustainability of the transition process are put at risk./////On this point, one does not have to be a military expert. Simple common sense will tell you this is the rational way forward. And that is what matters in the end./////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, our colleague Mr Omid Nouripour (The Greens) would like to ask you a question./////Federal Foreign Minister Westerwelle://///Please, go ahead./////Omid Nouripour (Alliance 90/The Greens)://///Mr Minister, you have just said that, if possible and if the security situation permits, the presence of German servicemen and women in Afghanistan is to be reduced by the end of this year. I have the following question: Are you excluding the possibility that the mandate ceiling could in the meantime be raised due to the employment of AWACS planes, or that some of the flexible reserve personnel may be brought in?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///On this issue, I share the position of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and I suggest you take a close look at it./////Generally speaking, travelling seems to purify the mind-because SPD Chairman Sigmar Gabriel in an interview today said that these are two separate matters. Germany has declared that, for the time being, we are not participating in the AWACS operation, since we are focusing on basic and further training. Apart from this, we naturally discuss and reassess everything with our Allies at regular intervals. Therefore, the question of whether I would exclude anything may be useful for political bickering between parties, but it is totally inappropriate as regards substance-considering that, in an alliance, we can only succeed together. This question is totally inappropriate!/////I am telling you this, dear colleague, because I believe you really could learn a thing or two from the larger opposition party, the SPD./////These days, the Social Democratic Party is struggling to find a position, holding discussions, and weighing the arguments, and it has publicly stated in response to the Federal Government's request that it will not abandon our men and women in uniform, and that it wants to support them./////Your party is completely different. No foreign minister sent as many service members into missions abroad as The Greens' foreign minister-but your memory grew clouded as soon as you switched to the opposition./////What you are doing is irresponsible-I repeat, irresponsible!/////Vice-President Hermann Otto Solms://///Mr Minister, would you reply to a question by our colleague Mr Stefan Liebich (The Left)?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///Yes./////Stefan Liebich (The Left)://///Mr Foreign Minister, you have just read some passages from the text that we will be voting on, but not from the section that is up for vote. Can you confirm that the condition the SPD has made a prerequisite for its consent is not even met in the Federal Government's motion, and that what you have read here, along with every figure indicating a withdrawal, is merely mentioned in the explanatory part of the motion?/////Guido Westerwelle, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs://///I will give you a short reply-although you have been a member of the German Bundestag not for a few weeks, but for a few months already./////With all due respect, dear colleague, you should know that it is standard practice for us to submit a text, for which the explanatory part of course forms the political context. Are you seriously suggesting that the German Bundestag resolve that the German Government is confident? I think the German Bundestag should be more self-assured here. The armed forces operate under a parliamentary mandate, not a government one. That is why the German Bundestag has the final say. Anything else would be surreal./////It will then be our task to make every effort to move forward this year the process that we will hopefully unanimously, or at any rate by a large majority, agree in this House. Last year, three important milestones were set along the path towards the political solution we seek: London, Kabul, and the conference in Lisbon. This year will see another important milestone right here in Germany, namely the Conference on Afghanistan in Bonn. I predict that this conference, scheduled for the end of the year, will focus on the high-stake issues: a political solution, reintegration, including reconciliation, and dialogue. This Afghanistan conference must however also concentrate on the time following 2014. This was where I left off before the questions were asked./////Dear colleagues, anyone who now conveys the impression in Afghanistan that, as of 2014, people will be left in the lurch-because we don't care about them any longer, they can do what they want and should handle things on their own-he or she will only find that no progress will be made on good governance or on the fight against drug trafficking and corruption, or on democratic development, which is our common objective. We would thereby risk the partners we need for building up the country on a secure and permanent basis turning their backs on us-due to fear for their own, and their families', lives./////This would not be responsible policy; what we want is a responsible handover of responsibility. Something that has been jointly decided in the German Bundestag must be completed in a responsible way. And you must not disappoint the friends you need to enhance security also here in Germany, given the threat of terrorism./////As a member of the United Nations Security Council, we have taken on a coordinating role as regards Afghanistan. I will therefore address the German Bundestag on a regular basis on this topic. I assume that we will also hold regular discussions in the committees. I can assure you that I will keep you, that is your spokespeople and representatives, informed on progress whenever possible. You have probably noticed that I have done so in recent months, and this practice will be continued. In my opinion, a broad majority in the German Bundestag is not so much a political issue, but rather would stand for clear support for the men and women in the Bundeswehr, who are risking their lives in Afghanistan for our freedom and security./////Such a broad majority is also of importance for our international partners, and for our Allies-so they can rest assured that there is broad political support./////Politicians must be prepared to shoulder responsibility, even if this costs them some opinion poll percentage points./////What is most important is the security, freedom, and future of our country and of Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen of the opposition, and of The Greens: you should follow the example of the Social Democrats. These words coming from me should give you pause for thought./////Thank you./////",0.2
International trade,    07.06.2010 - Speech,Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the occasion of Africa Day - Federal Foreign Office ,Speech,"__ Translation of advance text __/////Fifty years ago, the world watched Africa with fascination as seventeen countries declared their independence in 1960. It was the beginning of the end of European colonization. It was the beginning of the self-determination and awakening of an entire continent./////For these reasons, the year 1960 is referred to as the ""Year of Africa"". 2010 has the potential to become a new ""Year of Africa"". The FIFA World Cup will kick off in Johannesburg just three days from now. This will be the first time this global event has ever been hosted on the African continent. It is sure to shape the world's view of Africa as a whole for years to come. We know this from experience. For us, the summer of 2006 was extremely beneficial for Ger­many's image abroad. Four years ago in Germany we celebrated our ""summer fairy tale"". As winter is just beginning in the southern hemisphere, I hope South Africa will have ""winter fairy tale""./////After the World Cup, the world will view Africa differently than it ever has before./////Four years ago the whole world was surprised by Germany. The Germans could actually be really friendly! We were able to prove many of the cliches false. Even before the World Cup the Germans were more relaxed, funny, tolerant, peaceful and hospitable than many people wanted to believe. But it was the World Cup that helped people who had never been to Ger­many understand this./////For South Africa and for the entire continent the World Cup is a huge opportunity. It is a chance to dispel an image of Africa that is burdened with prejudices. This image of Africa is, at best, a distorted picture. Africa is much more than poverty, crises and disasters. Many Afri­can economies are growing nearly as quickly as their Asian counterparts. Africa is on the rise, politically and economically, as I was able to see for myself during my trip to Tanzania, South Africa and Djibouti at the beginning of April./////I don't want to play down Africa's problems-there is certainly a lot of catching up to do. There are still many conflicts and problems to be resolved. But when I look at Africa, I see above all major opportunities and incredible potential./////We need a fresh perspective on Africa. We need a perspective that acknowledges the efforts and successes of individual countries. A perspective that looks closely at which states violate human rights and which states protect them. A modern view of Africa sees countries that are addressing the challenges their continent is facing. Increasingly, African solutions are being found for African problems./////The foundation for this was laid on Africa Day, which we are commemorating today, a bit belatedly. On 25 May 1963, 32 independent African states signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)./////This was a huge step for the young nations of Africa. Today the organization that succeeded the OAU, the African Union (AU), is a key partner for the European Union in Africa./////For instance, Germany is assisting the African Union in building an operations centre in Addis Ababa and in training Somali police officers in Ethiopia. We also support the African Union's Border Programme. The goal is to mediate border disputes before they escalate into conflicts. Along with the United Nations, we support the efforts to resolve the conflicts in Sudan. Peace and security in Africa will remain a foreign policy priority for Germany./////In business, too, we would like to have more interaction. Economic exchange is indispensable for the peaceful coexistence of peoples and nations. As a member of the Free Democratic Party, I believe that close economic ties, investment, trade and entrepreneurship are key. They create jobs, growth and prosperity here in Germany as well as in Africa. The growth in many African countries is impressive. A new middle class is gradually emerging and its growing purchasing power bolsters domestic demand. An increasing number of international companies are discovering Africa's potential as an investment location. We support these positive developments. We want Africa to rise and prosper. Peace and stability, economic development and cultural understanding for Africa are goals of our foreign policy./////",0.2

These funds enable German and international relief organizations to supply aid to those in need./////The targets of funding include/////Although the referendum was almost entirely peaceful, the humanitarian situation in the Sudan remains tense. UN figures suggest that there are still nearly four million internally displaced persons. Altogether, 20 percent of the population are dependent on humanitarian aid./////Before and during the referendum, around 180,000 Southern Sudanese returned from the north. The local authorities do not have the capacity to provide enough emergency accommodation, food and basic health care. In parts of Darfur, the supply of aid also remains problematic, particularly in areas which are difficult to reach for security reasons./////Over the past two years, the German Government has made more than 30 million euro available for humanitarian assistance in the Sudan./////",0.4
