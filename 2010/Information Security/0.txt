    29.11.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (29 November) on the publication of internal United States diplomatic documents by the website WikiLeaks:
 


The publication of these internal documents is a regrettable development, and the extent of the damage is difficult to estimate given the large quantity of confidential information involved.I can only hope that the publication of these documents does not result in any compromise to the security of our country or of our allies. In view of this consideration we will have to review the information that has been made public.I have instructed the Federal Foreign Office to analyse the content of the material and to assess the extent to which the foreign policy and security interests of our country are affected.As for German-American relations, I can assure you that we work in close and friendly cooperation with the American Government, and that this shall remain so.â€œ
