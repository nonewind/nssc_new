Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle had a meeting today (24 March) in Berlin with Tsipi Livni, the leader of the Israeli Opposition and chair of the Kadima Party.
The main focus of their talks were current developments in the Middle East Peace Process and the dispute with Iran over its nuclear programme.
Westerwelle emphasized the German Government’s support for the statement issued in Moscow by the Middle East Quartet. It was vital that proximity talks succeed in getting the parties back to the negotiating table as soon as possible.
On the subject of Iran’s nuclear programme, Minister Westerwelle underlined the German Government’s grave concern about Iran’s continued intransigence. This could not and would not remain without a response from the international community.
