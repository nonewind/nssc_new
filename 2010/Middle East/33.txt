    20.08.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (20 August) issued the following statement on the announcement that direct peace talks are to begin between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority:
”This is an important signal for the peace process, giving rise to fresh hope of rapid progress towards a two-state solution. The Federal Government and its partners in the Middle East Quartet have worked hard to foster an environment in which the proximity talks can become direct peace talks.
It is now up to the parties concerned to show farsightedness and courage in seeking solutions to all outstanding key issues. I appeal to both sides to seize this opportunity and create an atmosphere for the negotiations which will allow confidence to grow.
Together with our partners we will do everything in our power to support this process.“
