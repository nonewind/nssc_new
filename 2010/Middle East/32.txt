    22.02.2010 - Press release
”Germany – Experience New Perspectives“ is the motto of the 2nd International Diplomats Programme which will be officially opened on 24 February 2010.
The International Diplomats Programme is an on-the-job course organized by the Federal Foreign Office and is designed for young diplomats from the Middle East, North Africa, as well as South and South-East Asia. This year twelve young diplomats will take part in the programme. The programme guides the participants through Berlin and Germany’s federal states where they are able to gain insight into both German and global issues that go beyond the everyday life of a diplomat.
The International Diplomats Programme is a joint initiative of the Federal Foreign Office’s Training for International Diplomats and the BMW Stiftung Herbert Quandt and is supported by the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP).
