    14.09.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (14 September) on the continuation of direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh:
“We are observing today’s events in Sharm el-Sheikh very closely. Following the start of direct talks in Washington, the task now is to enter into substantive negotiations.
I hope that both sides will seek solutions in a constructive spirit, also when it comes to dealing with difficult issues. They should refrain from doing anything which could jeopardize the talks and create a positive environment to facilitate their success.
We attach great importance to the continuation of the negotiations. We support them and are striving to strengthen the moderate forces in the region willing to enter into talks.”
