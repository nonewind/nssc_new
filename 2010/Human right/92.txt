    09.07.2010 - Press release
Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement today (9 July) after the announcement by the Cuban Government that it is to release 52 political prisoners:
“The announcement by the Cuban Government is a step in the right direction which must be followed by others. I’m now counting on its speedy implementation.
I also call upon the Cuban Government to release the other political prisoners and to take further steps to ensure that human rights are respected in Cuba. The improvement of the human rights situation is of key importance to our relations.
I would like to thank my Spanish colleague Miguel Ángel Moratinos for his mediation efforts during the last few days.”
The European Union will review its Common Position on Cuba and on the human rights situation in the light of the latest developments.
In line with the EU’s Common Position on Cuba of 1996, the German Government and the EU member states are working at both European and bilateral level to ensure that human rights are respected in Cuba. Within the framework of the EU-Cuba dialogue, the EU stressed the importance of progress in the spheres of democratization, human rights and political freedoms.
