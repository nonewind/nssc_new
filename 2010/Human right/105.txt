On Sunday (21 November) Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, together with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, will open the Nuremberg Trials Memorial permanent exhibition in the Palace of Justice building in Nuremberg.
The Memorial, which opens to the public on 22 November, is intended to be a place of information and commemoration and will provide information at the actual site on the background to, course of and impact of the Nuremberg War Trials, right up to the establishment of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
In 1945 Nuremberg saw the birth of international criminal law. Today the principle that there must be no impunity for the perpetrators of the worst human rights crimes is universally applicable. This exhibition makes a visible contribution towards preserving the legacy of Nuremberg and presenting Germanyâ€™s continuing commitment.
