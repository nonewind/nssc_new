Human Rights Commissioner Löning leaves for Manila - Federal Foreign Office 
    20.01.2011 - Press release
Markus Löning, Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, is embarking on a five-day visit to Manila today (20 January 2011). Part of the reason for his visit is a request from Leila de Lima, Philippine Secretary of Justice and known defender of human rights, that the German Government assist the Philippines in implementing structures to uphold the rule of law.
Alongside Leila de Lima, Markus Löning will also meet President Aquino to make concrete suggestions of ways in which Germany could support the rule of law. A further aspect of the visit will involve the Commissioner inspecting the EU-Philippines Justice Support Programme (EPJUST) led by Berlin senior public prosecutor Detlev Mehlis.
