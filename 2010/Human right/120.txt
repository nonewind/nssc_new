Federal Minister Westerwelle concerned at escalation in Tunisia - Federal Foreign Office 
    13.01.2011 - Press release
Commenting on the continuing violence in Tunisia, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle today (13 January) issued the following statement in Berlin:



“The news of the escalating unrest in Tunisia and the images of dead and injured people are extremely worrying.We condemn all violence. We call for an end to the massive use of force against demonstrators and for fundamental human and civil rights and rule of law principles to be respected and protected.This includes the early realization of the release of all political prisoners as announced by the Tunisian Government. This would issue a serious signal for dialogue. Only through dialogue and calm can the country’s problems be solved.If Tunisia is to move closer to the European Union, rule of law principles must be adhered to. That is why, at our initiative, the European Union’s Political and Security Committee will tomorrow again discuss the situation in Tunisia.In addition, given the precarious situation in the country, we have today again amended our Travel and Security Advice: in the light of the uncertain situation, we are currently advising against non-essential trips to Tunisia.”
