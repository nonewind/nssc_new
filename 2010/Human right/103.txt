French politician and former President of the European Parliament Simone Veil was awarded this year’s European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma in the Federal Foreign Office today. Hosting the event, Cornelia Pieper, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, issued the following statement:


“To this day, too many people fall victim to racism and xenophobia. That is why it is so important that we address the issue of human rights publicly time and again, thus ensuring that attention remains focused on them. In this respect, the importance of the European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma cannot be overestimated.”

The Prize was awarded by the Manfred Lautenschläger Foundation in collaboration with the Central Committee of German Sinti and Roma and the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma.
