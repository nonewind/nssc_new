Tomorrow (18 June), Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle is to open the exhibition “Sport – a world language” in a ceremony attended by Ivo Visković, Serbian Ambassador to Germany, and Frank Dürr, Director of the German Sport and Olympic Museum in Cologne.
The exhibition showcases the different aspects of sports promotion performed by the Federal Foreign Office. 20 information panels give an insight into developments from the early days in 1961 right up to current projects in Africa and Afghanistan and examples of institutions active in training coaches.
In turn, two large banners showing the football stars Bastian Schweinsteiger and Didier Drogba will be on display outside the Atrium to raise awareness for the WASH United initiative, a campaign for the human right to have access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation.
After the exhibition is opened, the World Cup match Germany versus Serbia will be shown on the big screen in the Atrium.
