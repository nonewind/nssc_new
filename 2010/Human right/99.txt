World Press Freedom Day - Federal Foreign Office 
    03.05.2010 - Press release
In honour of World Press Freedom Day 2010, Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued the following statement in Berlin today (3 May):
”Without press freedom, there can be no freedom of opinion.These two freedoms are inalienable fundamental and human rights. A working democracy is unimaginable without the right to freely express opinions and the critical assessment of state action by a free press.That is why we will continue refusing to look the other way when journalists are persecuted or political opponents are oppressed.“
