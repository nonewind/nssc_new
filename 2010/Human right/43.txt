Human Rights Commissioner’s visit to Zagreb to focus on judicial reform in Croatia - Federal Foreign Office 
    16.09.2010 - Press release
Croatia’s reform of its justice system is the principal topic of the visit to Zagreb by Markus Löning, the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights.
The European Union has demanded that Croatia take further measures to combat corruption, tackle war crimes and improve cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Only after these reforms have been concluded can the chapter of the EU accession negotiations on the judiciary and fundamental rights be closed.
”Croatia has successfully completed the greater part of its journey towards EU membership and is now in the final phase of its accession negotiations. The chapter on the judiciary and fundamental rights contains the most basic of our European values.
Its full implementation is not only an essential prerequisite for accession, but is also in Croatia’s own interest. We would like to encourage the Croatian partners to take the necessary steps to this end and will do all we can to support them on this path,“
said Löning before arriving in Zagreb.
The Commissioner’s appointments today include talks with the Croatian Minister of Justice, the President of the Constitutional Court, Members of Parliament and civil society representatives.
