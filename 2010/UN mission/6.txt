United Nations reinforces peacekeeping mission in Côte d’Ivoire - Federal Foreign Office 
    19.01.2011 - Press release
The United Nations Security Council today (19 January) adopted Resolution 1967 to boost the UN peacekeeping mission in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI). The Resolution has had Germany’s active support.
The main tasks of UNOCI are peacekeeping and protecting the civilian population in Côte d’Ivoire. The deployment of 2000 additional troops which has been authorized by Resolution 1967 stems from a proposal by the UN Secretary-General and is intended to put UNOCI in a position to fulfil its mandate properly.During the weeks prior to this Resolution being adopted, supporters of former President Laurent Gbagbo had launched numerous attacks on civilians as well as UNOCI troops and prevented the peacekeepers from carrying out their duties.
Within both the European Union and the United Nations, the German Government has actively supported the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Côte d’Ivoire from the outset.Germany places particular emphasis on supporting the efforts being made by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union to mediate between the parties.
